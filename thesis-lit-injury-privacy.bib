abstract = {The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments in the field of wearable sensors and systems that are relevant to the field of rehabilitation. The growing body of work focused on the application of wearable technology to monitor older adults and subjects with chronic conditions in the home and community settings justifies the emphasis of this review paper on summarizing clinical applications of wearable technology currently undergoing assessment rather than describing the development of new wearable sensors and systems. A short description of key enabling technologies (i.e. sensor technology, communication technology, and data analysis techniques) that have allowed researchers to implement wearable systems is followed by a detailed description of major areas of application of wearable technology. Applications described in this review paper include those that focus on health and wellness, safety, home rehabilitation, assessment of treatment efficacy, and early detection of disorders. The integration of wearable and ambient sensors is discussed in the context of achieving home monitoring of older adults and subjects with chronic conditions. Future work required to advance the field toward clinical deployment of wearable sensors and systems is discussed.},

abstract = {Running symmetry is important for performance, injury prevention or rehabilitation in many sports. However, current methods for measuring running symmetry are expensive, time consuming and must typically be constrained to a non-task representative laboratory setting. The aim of this study was to validate a method that used accelerometry data to determine running symmetry during maximal over ground sprinting for abled bodied athletes. Thirteen elite male athletes performed three 40m maximal sprints on an indoor running track while data were collected from eight force plates and an accelerometer positioned between the scapulae against the spine. Correlations and Bland–Altman analyses were used to assess validity. Time spent either side of the vertical axis was compared to maximal medio-lateral force from either side of the body using a symmetry index approach. Results revealed only a trivial relationship (r¼0.088, p¼0.616) and poor agreement (bias¼0.189, p¼0.000). Likewise, stride time from the accelerometer and force plates exhibited a small relationship (rs¼?0.177, p¼0.310) and significant bias (bias¼?0.026, p¼0.000), yet showed smaller limits of agreement. It was concluded that both of the methods for measuring sprinting asymmetry using accelerometer data had poor internal validity. However, of these measures, stride time showed the best capacity to calculate running symmetry during maximal effort sprints. Overall, it is suggested that coaches exhibit caution when interpreting running symmetry measures from accelerometers, and also carefully consider where the accelerometer is placed},

abstract = { The epidemiology and aetiology of ankle sprain injuries in soccer have been well described. Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data identified an English Premier League player sustaining a high lateral ankle sprain. GPS data collated during the training session in which the injury was sustained, and subsequent rehabilitation sessions was analysed to quantify uni-axial PlayerLoad metrics. The injured player revealed a 3:1 asymmetrical loading pattern in the medio-lateral plane and multi-axial high loading events which might present the inciting event to injury. The high magnitude, asymmetrical and multi-planar loading is consistent with lateral ankle sprain aetiology. },

abstract = {This research explores the usability of a GPS data-logging device designed for team-based sports as a mechanism for collecting data on snowsport participants' temporal and spatial use of alpine resorts. Usability for participants was high, however there are a few issues for the research that were challenging, but the quality and quantity of data obtained outweighs any limitations identified. Thus the researchers believe that GPS Spi Elite is a useful resource for tracking snowsport participants' temporal and spatial use of alpine resorts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
