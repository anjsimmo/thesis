abstract = {The generic term “game style” is often used to infer a way a team has performed or a playing pattern that has developed. However, this concept has not previously been measured. This study developed a generic model to measure game styles among field sports. Specifically, game styles of 6 Australian Football League (AFL) teams were assessed using 12 performance indicators, during the 2015 season. These variables were allocated to one of five “moments” of play: established offence/defence, transition to offence/defence and set pieces. A game style plot was generated using z-scores to show each team's deviance from the sample average. Among the six AFL teams, there were many common features of game style indicating teams were trying to play in similar ways. Plots identified specific moments of relatively weaker or stronger performance, and hence areas for improvement. Correlation analysis demonstrated significant correlations between the total sum of z-scores across moments and success (premiership position $\rho$ = −1, p = .025; and scoring percentage $\rho$ = .943, p = .035). Game style plots are easy to interpret, can highlight areas of concern in specific play periods or phases, and help marry training drills with deficiencies in various moments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure chlamydia testing and positivity rates among 16-39 year olds attending Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Retrospective non-identifiable computerised records containing consultation and chlamydia testing data were collected for patients (16-39 years) attending eight ACCHSs during 2008-09 in urban, regional and remote settings for the Australian Collaboration for Chlamydia Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) system. Annual chlamydia testing and positivity rates were estimated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Over two years, 13,809 patients aged 16-39 years (57.8{\%} female, 82.3{\%} Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander) attended. The annual overall chlamydia testing rate was 13.0{\%} (2008) and 16.0{\%} (2009). Testing rates were higher among females (p{\textless}0.001) and among patients aged 16-29 than 30-39 years (males: p=0.01; females: p{\textless}0.001). Chlamydia positivity was 8.5{\%} overall; similar in females (8.7{\%}) and males (7.8{\%}) (p=0.46); highest among 16-19 years (females: 17.4{\%}; males: 13.0{\%}), declining to 1.5{\%} among females 35-39 years (p{\textless}0.001) and 4.8{\%} among males 30-34 years (p{\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia testing at these ACCHSs approached recommended levels among some patient groups, however, it should increase. High positivity among younger people highlights they should be targeted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPLICATIONS: Young people should be targeted for sexual health interventions. ACCHSs are well placed to provide enhanced sexual health services if appropriately resourced.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural genetic variation contributes towards athletic performance in various strength/power and endurance based sports. To date, no studies have explored the genetic predisposition towards skill and athletic performance in Australian Football (AF) players. METHODS: The present pilot study recruited 30 sub-elite AF players who completed tests of endurance, power and technical skill. Specific polymorphisms in nine genes were screened, and assessed for a possible association with athletic and skill traits. RESULTS: Statistical analysis using generalized linear models identified a number of polymorphisms predictive of endurance and technical skill. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), normally responsible for regulation of body fluid volume, was a significant factor in predicting 'all round' athletic performance and skill. Specifically, the deletion allele (DD) of ACE was identified as a predictor for AF power (p{\textless}/=0.008), endurance (p=0.001) and skill assessments (p{\textless}/=0.003). In addition, polymorphisms in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, D2 dopamine receptor, and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes were also shown to contribute to kicking skill outcomes (p{\textless}/=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to implicate the ACE deletion allele for a multi-dimensional sport in such a way. Further, the results from this study have identified several new candidate genes in predicting athletic and technical skill outcomes.},

abstract = {Objectives: To develop a physiological performance and anthropometric attribute model to predict Australian Football League draft selection. Design: Cross-sectional observational. Methods: Data was obtained ( n= 4902) from three Under-18 Australian football competitions between 2010 and 2013. Players were allocated into one of the three groups, based on their highest level of selection in their final year of junior football (Australian Football League Drafted, n= 292; National Championship, n= 293; State-level club, n= 4317). Physiological performance (vertical jumps, agility, speed and running endurance) and anthropometric (body mass and height) data were obtained. Hedge's effect sizes were calculated to assess the influence of selection-level and competition on these physical attributes, with logistic regression models constructed to discriminate Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players. Rule induction analysis was undertaken to determine a set of rules for discriminating selection-level. Results: Effect size comparisons revealed a range of small to moderate differences between State-level club players and both other groups for all attributes, with trivial to small differences between Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players noted. Logistic regression models showed multistage fitness test, height and 20. m sprint time as the most important attributes in predicting Draft success. Rule induction analysis showed that players displaying multistage fitness test scores of {\textgreater}14.01 and/or 20. m sprint times of {\textless}2.99 s were most likely to be recruited. Conclusions: High levels of performance in aerobic and/or speed tests increase the likelihood of elite junior Australian football players being recruited to the highest level of the sport.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Police officers are required to perform dynamic movements in unpredictable environments, the results of which can lead to injury. Early identification of poor movement patterns of a police population, and potential sub groups within this population, may provide opportunities to treat and minimise injury risks. The aim of this study was to profile the functional movement capabilities of an Australian state police force and potential sub groups through a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective data from an Australian State Police Force were provided for analysis (male symbol n = 1155, mean (+/-SD) age = 31.34 +/- 8.41 years: female symbol n = 357, mean age = 27.99 +/- 8.02 years). Data consisted of Functional Movement Screen (FMS) assessment results of male and female trainees and qualified police officers with all assessments conducted by a qualified Police Physical Training Instructor. RESULTS: Significantly higher (U = 253863, p {\textless} .001) FMS total scores were found for recruits (mean 15.23 +/- SD 2.01 points) when compared to attested officers (14.57 +/- 2.96 points) and differences in FMS total scores also approached significance for females (15.24 +/- 2.35 points) when compared to males (14.84 +/- 2.55 points, U = 186926, p = .007), with age found to be a key, significant factor in explaining these observed differences (F (1,1507) = 23.519, p {\textless} .001). The FMS components demonstrating poorest movement performance across all groups were the hurdle step and rotary stability. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, police personnel (both attested officers and recruits of both genders) of greater age have a lower functional movement capability when compared to younger personnel, with greater percentages scoring 14 or below on the FMS. Specific conditioning programs to improve strength, range of motion and stability during identified key movement types in those demonstrating poorer movement performance may serve to reduce injuries in police personnel.},

abstract = {—Concussion in Rugby is an important public health issue and there is a clear need for concussion-reducing headgear. It is not clear whether currently available soft headgear can mitigate the effects of a concussive impact and it is concerning that a notable proportion of the playing population have a misbelief in their protective effect. In order to enhance development of modern and effective headgear, this study investigated suitability of smart polymer materials via both standardised and novel biomechanical test methodologies. Superior performances of the smart polymers to that of the existing products were generally observed and resulted in the reductions of at least 40{\%} in the probability of concussion. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) severity rating suggested two-fold improvement over the existing headgear if the smart polymers were used as a replacement for the cushioning material in the current products.},
