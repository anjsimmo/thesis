abstract = {Abstract We examined space–time patterns of basketball players during competition by analysing movement data obtained from six game sequences. Strong in-phase relations in the longitudinal (basket-to-basket) direction were observed for all playing dyads, especially player–opponent dyads matched for playing position, indicating that these movements were very constrained by the game demands. Similar findings for in-phase relations were observed for the most part in the lateral direction, the main exception being dyads comprising the two wing players from the same team. These dyads instead demonstrated strong attractions to anti-phase, a consequence perhaps of seeking to increase and decrease team width in tandem. Single instances from select dyads and game sequences demonstrated further evidence of phase stabilities and phase transitions on some occasions. Together, these findings demonstrate that space–time movement patterns of playing dyads in basketball, while unique, nonetheless conform to a uniform des...},

abstract = {Abstract There is a need for a collective variable that captures the dynamics of team sports like soccer at match level. The centroid positions and surface areas of two soccer teams potentially describe the coordinated flow of attacking and defending in small-sided soccer games at team level. The aim of the present study was to identify an overall game pattern by establishing whether the proposed variables were linearly related between teams over the course of the game. In addition, we tried to identify patterns in the build-up of goals. A positive linear relation and a negative linear relation were hypothesized for the centroid positions and surface areas respectively. Finally, we hypothesized that deviations from these patterns are present in the build-up of goals. Ten young male elite soccer players (mean age 17.3, s=0.7) played three small-sided soccer games (4-a-side) of 8 minutes as part of their regular training routine.

abstract = {Small-sided games are commonly used in training and teaching contexts of football. However, few studies have focused on the tactical implications of this type of drills. The aim of this study is to identify how tactical collective behaviour varies with age in different small-sided game formats. We investigated the in-game field position in three different age groups of youth football players [under-9 (n=10; age = 8.5 ± 0.53), under-11 (n=10; age = 10.4 ± 0.52) and under-13 (n=10; age = 12.7 ± 0.48)], participating in two different small-sided game conditions (GK + 3 × 3 + GK and GK + 4 × 4 + GK). A team variable was created based on the players' length per width ratio (lpwratio), and a match variable was calculated as the distance between the centroid of the two teams. Results show that team variable values were influenced by the age of the players, as younger teams tend to present a higher value of lpwratio in their dispersion on the pitch. The variability of this variable also showed a decrease for teams with older players, suggesting a more consistent application of the width (stretching and creating space) and concentration (compressing into a confined area) principles of play and reflecting a higher level of collective tactical behaviour. Match variable showed a larger centroid distance for the older age groups in comparison with the younger players in the GK + 3 × 3 + GK, while all age groups demonstrated similar large centroid distances in the GK + 4 × 4 + GK game format. These results suggest that length and width ratio and centroid distance are useful measures of tactical performance in small-sided games in youth football.},

@article{oshaughnessy_possession_2006,
abstract = {In sports like Australian Rules football and soccer, teams must battle to achieve possession of the ball in sufficient space to make optimal use of it. Ultimately the teams need to score, and to do that the ball must be brought into the area in front of goal – the place where the defence usually concentrates on shutting down space and opportunity time. Coaches would like to quantify the trade-offs between contested play in good positions and uncontested play in less promising positions, in order to inform their decisionmaking about where to put their players, and when to gamble on sending the ball to a contest rather than simply maintain possession. To evaluate football strategies, Champion Data has collected the on-ground locations of all 350,000 possessions and stoppages in the past two seasons of AFL (2004, 2005). By following each chain of play through to the next score, we can now reliably estimate the scoreboard “equity” of possessing the ball at any location, and measure the effect of having sufficient time to dispose of it effectively. As expected, winning the ball under physical pressure (through a “hard ball get”) is far more difficult to convert into a score than winning it via a mark. We also analyse some equity gradients to show how getting the ball 20 metres closer to goal is much more important in certain areas of the ground than in others. We conclude by looking at the choices faced by players in possession wanting to maximise their likelihood of success.},

We identified six game sequences at random, from which the movement data of each player were obtained for analysis of team behaviours in both the longitudinal (basket-to-basket) and lateral (side-to-side) directions. The central position of a team was measured using its spatial (geometric) centre and dispersion using a stretch index, obtained from the mean distance of team members from the spatial centre. Relative-phase analysis of the spatial centres demonstrated in-phase stabilities in both the longitudinal and lateral directions, with more stability in the longitudinal than lateral direction. As anticipated, this finding is consistent with the results of an analysis of individual playing dyads (see companion article, this issue), as well as the more general principle of complex systems conforming to similar descriptions at different levels of analysis.

abstract = {It is often desirable to analyse trajectory data in local coordinates relative to a reference location. Similarly, temporal data also needs to be transformed to be relative to an event. Together, temporal and spatial contextualisation permits comparative analysis of similar trajectories taken across multiple reference locations. To the GIS professional, the procedures to establish a reference frame at a location and reproject the data into local coordinates are well known, albeit tedious. However, GIS tools are now often used by subject matter experts who may not have the deep knowledge of coordinate frames and projections required to use these techniques effectively. We introduce a novel method for representing spatio-temporal reference frames using ordinary geographic objects available in GIS tools. We argue that our method both reduces the number of manual steps required to reproject data to a local reference frame, in addition to reducing the number of concepts a novice user would need to learn.},

abstract = {In the last years, sports scientists have increasingly considered teams to be complex, dynamical systems and have started to capture their team dynamics based on tracked positional data. However, few studies have focused on the influence of specific performance constraints such as the defense playing method in the team dispersion behaviors. The aim of this exploratory study was to analyze the influence of changing the defense playing method from zone defense to man-to-man defense, in the team dispersion behaviors during small-sided soccer games. We analyzed two small-sided games played by two teams of 6 players (5 outfield players plus a goalkeeper). In the first experimental condition both teams used zone defense, and in the second condition they changed to man-to-man defense. Team dispersion behaviors were captured by four compound variables found in literature--surface area, stretch index, length per with ratio (lpwratio) and teams' centers distance. Results suggested that the defensive playing method influences team dispersion behaviors. Compared to man-to-man defense, using zone defense teams showed low values of surface area (326 ± 139 m² vs. 360 ± 172 m² for Team 1 and 195 ± 111 m² vs. 265 ± 133 m² for Team 2) and length per with ratio (0.70 ± 0.20 vs. 0.80 ± 0.42 for Team 1 and 0.47 ± 0.21 vs. 0.58 ± 0.24 for Team 2). Contrariwise, zone defense implied high values of distance between the geometrical centers (8.6 ± 2.3 m vs. 5.4 ± 1.6 m), when compared to man-to-man defense, respectively. Stretch index values were not similar for the two teams as Team 1 showed high values for zone defense (15.7 ± 2.8 m vs. 15.2 ± 3.0 m), and Team 2 showed low values for zone defense (10.9 ± 2.8 m vs. 11.6 ± 2.6 m). These findings, although at an exploratory level, suggest that teams adopting zone defense tend to be more compacted, especially in the wide direction of the field. Moreover, zone defense also implied a more structured spatial behavior with teams enlarging the distance between each other.},

The whole analysis includes two parts. In Part I, the individual and collective behaviors of the players of the two teams as well as the motion of the ball are presented as various time series. Geometrical centers, radii, expansion speeds, possession functions of the two teams are defined and calculated as functions of time. Major ranges of all players as well as of different groups of players (defenders, midfielders, forwards) of the two teams during the entire first half, the attacking phase of team A and the attacking phase of team B are calculated, respectively, showing the structures of the two teams during different phases. Distance coverage of each player and the mean distances covered by different groups of players (defenders, midfielders, forwards) during different phases are calculated. The time portions of possession of the ball by each team and the time portions of different phases are also calculated. In Part II, energy and spectral analysis and various correlations will be derived. The relation between various parameters and potential indicators will be discussed. The major purpose of the present study is to offer some general mathematical tools for the detailed analysis and to reveal some general features of soccer match when the detailed 2D data are available. The results would offer the raw materials for various potential indicators which may eventually be used in the coaching process to enhance the performance and in the prediction of the results of soccer matches. 1.},

abstract = {Small-sided and conditioned games (SSCGs) in sport have been modelled as complex adaptive systems. Research has shown that the relative space per player (RSP) formulated in SSCGs can impact on emergent tactical behaviours. In this study we adopted a systems orientation to analyse how different RSP values, obtained through manipulations of player numbers, influenced four measures of interpersonal coordination observed during performance in SSCGs. For this purpose we calculated positional data (GPS 15 Hz) from ten U-15 football players performing in three SSCGs varying in player numbers (3v3, 4v4 and 5v5). Key measures of SSCG system behaviours included values of (1) players' dispersion, (2) teams' separateness, (3) coupling strength and time delays between participants' emerging movements, respectively. Results showed that values of participants' dispersion increased, but the teams' separateness remained identical across treatments. Coupling strength and time delay also showed consistent values across SSCGs. These results exemplified how complex adaptive systems, like football teams, can harness inherent degeneracy to maintain similar team spatial–temporal relations with opponents through changes in inter-individual coordination modes (i.e., players' dispersion). The results imply that different team behaviours might emerge at different ratios of field dimension/player numbers. Therefore, sport pedagogists should carefully evaluate the effects of changing RSP in SSCGs as a way of promoting increased or decreased pressure on players.},

abstract = {Following the calculations on the individual and collective behaviors of players and the ball in Part I, further calculations are carried out in Part II concerning (i) the specific kinetic energy of each player, (ii) the power densities of various quantities for different groups of players (forwards, defenders) and for the geometrical centers of the two teams, as well as for the ball, and (iii) the correlations of various quantities among different groups of players and the ball, as well as among the geometrical centers and the ball. Some parameters are compared between the two teams. The relation between these parameters and the potential indicators and all the influencing factors to the final result of a soccer match are discussed. Advantages and limitations of the present approach and some ideas for the future research are outlined.},

abstract = {The game of football demands new computational approaches to measure individual and collective performance. Understanding the phenomena involved in the game may foster the identification of strengths and weaknesses, not only of each player, but also of the whole team. The development of assertive quantitative methodologies constitutes a key element in sports training. In football, the predictability and stability inherent in the motion of a given player may be seen as one of the most important concepts to fully characterise the variability of the whole team. This paper characterises the predictability and stability levels of players during an official football match. A Fractional Calculus (FC) approach to define a player's trajectory. By applying FC, one can benefit from newly considered modeling perspectives, such as the fractional coefficient, to estimate a player's predictability and stability. This paper also formulates the concept of attraction domain, related to the tactical region of each player, inspired by stability theory principles. To compare the variability inherent in the player's process variables (e.g., distance covered) and to assess his predictability and stability, entropy measures are considered. Experimental results suggest that the most predictable player is the goalkeeper while, conversely, the most unpredictable players are the midfielders. We also conclude that, despite his predictability, the goalkeeper is the most unstable player, while lateral defenders are the most stable during the match.},
