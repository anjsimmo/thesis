abstract = {Computer scientists have recently undermined our faith in the privacy- protecting power of anonymization, the name for techniques that protect the privacy of individuals in large databases by deleting information like names and social security numbers. These scientists have demonstrated that they can often “reidentify” or “deanonymize” individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention. We must respond to the surprising failure of anonymization, and this Article provides the tools to do so.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Mendoza, Miller, Pedell and Sterling 2013. In this paper, we examine the role of peoples' emotions or feelings about a system and the associated system qualities in encouraging adoption and effective use of systems. In two different contexts, we examine the use of a learning management system in an educational setting and a personal emergency alarm system in an aged care setting. This study reveals that technology appropriation – a term used to capture adoption and ongoing use, is driven by different emotions depending on whether users are in the adoption decision-making stage or during actual use. Findings from this study also suggest that social factors influence peoples' emotions in the decision to adopt a system. However, as people use a system over time, it is the non-functional system qualities, based on personal experiences with the look, feel, functionality and features that trigger positive and negative emotional responses. Our findings therefore propose that these emotional responses should be considered during system design and implementation to encourage appropriation and avoid rejection of systems.},

abstract = {Technologies are introduced into an organization with the aim of improving productivity. However, persistent use of an information system is required to enhance productivity and user satisfaction. In this paper, we examine the process of technology appropriation and the influences that encourage and discourage use of an information system over time. In a longitudinal field study in an educational setting, we identify changing expectations and influences that encourage persistent use of a technology above and beyond adoption. Our work indicates that stabilization of a technology may only be temporary. Further appropriation may occur beyond initial stabilization as expectations and influences encourage new uses of a technology. We have found that the driving forces in encouraging productive use of a technology are the ability for users to experience the technology as useful and to have easy access to ongoing training.},

abstract = {—The way people feel about a technology can de-termine whether the technology is embraced or rejected by its intended users. People's feelings and emotions are particularly important for uptake of socio-technical systems involving social behaviour. For example, a photo sharing web application will not be used if people do not feel engaged or in-touch with their friends and family during use. Considering the feelings of the intended users of a system can uncover new requirements, leading to an improved and more accepted system. We contend that requirements engineering, in developing systems for the new social age, needs modified lightweight practices. In this paper, we propose adapting a requirements engineering methodology to include emotion modelling for socio-technical systems. We extend a set of existing agent oriented lightweight models to consider emotions, describe the process for modelling, and demonstrate both models and process in an example of personal alarm systems for older adults.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). The maturing of mobile devices and systems provides an unprecedented opportunity to collect a large amount of real world human motion data at all scales. While the rich knowledge contained in these data sets is valuable in many fields, various types of personally sensitive information can be easily learned from such trajectory data. The ones that are of most concerns are frequent locations, frequent co-locations and trajectory re-identification through spatio-temporal data points. In this work we analyze privacy protection and data utility when trajectory IDs are randomly mixed during co-location events for data collection or publication. We demonstrate through both analyses and simulations that the global geometric shape of each individual trajectory is sufficiently altered such that re-identification via frequent locations, co-location pairs or spatial temporal data points is not possible with high probability. Meanwhile, a decent number of local geometric features of the trajectory data set are still preserved, including the density distribution and local traffic flow.},

abstract = {Re-identification is a major privacy threat to public datasets containing individual records. Many privacy protection algorithms rely on generalization and suppression of "quasi-identifier" attributes such as ZIP code and birthdate. Their objective is usually syntactic sanitization: for example, k-anonymity requires that each "quasi-identifier" tuple appear in at least k records, while l-diversity requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes for each quasi-identifier have high entropy. The utility of sanitized data is also measured syntactically, by the number of generalization steps applied or the number of records with the same quasi-identifier. In this paper, we ask whether generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers offer any benefits over trivial sanitization which simply separates quasi-identifiers from sensitive attributes. Previous work showed that k-anonymous databases can be useful for data mining, but k-anonymization does not guarantee any privacy. By contrast, we measure the tradeoff between privacy (how much can the adversary learn from the sanitized records?) and utility, measured as accuracy of data-mining algorithms executed on the same sanitized records. For our experimental evaluation, we use the same datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as were used in previous research on generalization and suppression. Our results demonstrate that even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility. In most cases, trivial sanitization provides equivalent utility and better privacy than k-anonymity, l-diversity, and similar methods based on generalization and suppression.},

abstract = {A number of organizations publish microdata for purposes such as public health and demographic research. Although attributes that clearly identify individuals, such as Name and Social Security Number, are generally removed, these databases can sometimes be joined with other public databases on attributes such as Zipcode, Sex, and Birthdate to re-identify individuals who were supposed to remain anonymous. "Joining" attacks are made easier by the availability of other, complementary, databases over the Internet.K-anonymization is a technique that prevents joining attacks by generalizing and/or suppressing portions of the released microdata so that no individual can be uniquely distinguished from a group of size k. In this paper, we provide a practical framework for implementing one model of k-anonymization, called full-domain generalization. We introduce a set of algorithms for producing minimal full-domain generalizations, and show that these algorithms perform up to an order of magnitude faster than previous algorithms on two real-life databases.Besides full-domain generalization, numerous other models have also been proposed for k-anonymization. The second contribution in this paper is a single taxonomy that categorizes previous models and introduces some promising new alternatives.},

@article{Paay2009,
abstract = {This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to engineering socio-technical design. The paper addresses technological design for social interactions that are non-instrumental, and thereby sometimes contradictory or surprising and difficult to model. Through cooperative analysis of cultural probe data and development of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) models, ethnographers and software engineers participate in conversations around shared artifacts, which facilitate the transition from data collected in a social environment to a socially oriented requirements analysis for informing socio-technical design. To demonstrate how this transition was made, we present a case study of the process of designing technology to support familial relationships, such as playing, gifting, showing, telling and creating memories. The case study is based on data collected in a cultural probes study that explores the diverse, complex and unpredictable design environment of the home. A multidisciplinary team worked together through a process of conversations around shared artifacts to cooperatively analyze collected data and develop models. These conversations provided the opportunity to view the data from the perspective of alternative disciplines that resulted in the emergence of novel understandings and innovative practice. The artifacts in the process included returned probe items, scrapbooks, videos of interviews, photographs, family biographies and the AOSE requirements models. When shared between the two communities of practice, some of these artifacts played important roles in mediating discussions of mutual influence between ethnographers and software engineers. The shared artifacts acted as both triggers for conversations and information vessels-providing a variety of interpretable objects enabling both sides to articulate their understandings in different ways and to collaboratively negotiate understandings of the collected data. Analyzing the interdisciplinary exchange provided insight into the identification of bridging elements that allowed 'the social' to permeate the processes of analysis, requirements elicitation and design. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper argues that the introduction of any computer-based system to an organization transforms the organization and changes the work patterns of the system's users in the organization. These changes interact with the users' values and beliefs and trigger emotional responses which are sometimes directed against the computer-based system and its proponents. The paper debunks myths about how smoothly such organizational transformations take place, describes case studies showing how organizational transformation really takes place, and introduces and confirms by case studies some guidelines for eliciting requirements and the relevant emotional issues for a computer-based system that is being introduced into an organization to change its work patterns. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This system model is applicable to the complete human-computer system, including both computer systems in use and software products in use. A product quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics) that relate to static properties of software and dynamic properties of the computer system. The model is applicable to both computer systems and software products. The characteristics defined by both models are relevant to all software products and computer systems. The characteristics and subcharacteristics provide consistent terminology for specifying, measuring and evaluating system and software product quality. They also provide a set of quality characteristics against which stated quality requirements can be compared for completeness. Although the scope of the product quality model is intended to be software and computer systems, many of the characteristics are also relevant to wider systems and services. ISO/IEC 25012 contains a model for data quality that is complementary to this model. The scope of the models excludes purely functional properties, but it does include functional suitability. The scope of application of the quality models includes supporting specification and evaluation of software and software-intensive computer systems from different perspectives by those associated with their acquisition, requirements, development, use, evaluation, support, maintenance, quality assurance and control, and audit. The models can, for example, be used by developers, acquirers, quality assurance and control staff and independent evaluators, particularly those responsible for specifying and evaluating software product quality. Activities during product development that can benefit from the use of the quality models include: identifying software and system requirements; validating the comprehensiveness of a requirements definition; identifying software and system design objectives; identifying software and system testing objectives; identifying quality control criteria as part of quality assurance; identifying acceptance criteria for a software product and/or software-intensive computer system; establishing measures of quality characteristics in support of these activities.},

How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

abstract = {Over the years the software engineering community has increasingly realized the important role software architecture plays in fulfilling the quality requirements of a system. The quality attributes of a software system are, to a large extent determined by the system's software architecture. In recent years, the software engineering community has developed various tools and techniques that allow for design for quality attributes, such as performance or maintainability, at the software architecture level. We believe this design approach can be applied not only to "traditional" quality attributes such as performance or maintainability but also to usability. This survey explores the feasibility of such a design approach. Current practice is surveyed from the perspective of a software architect. Are there any design methods that allow for design for usability at the architectural level? Are there any evaluation tools that allow assessment of architectures for their support of usability? What is usability? A framework is presented which visualizes these three research questions. Usability should drive design at all stages, but current usability engineering practice fails to fully achieve this goal. Our survey shows that there are no design techniques or assessment tools that allow for design for usability at the architectural level. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
