abstract = {Old maps are increasingly used as a source for historical research. This is a consequence of the increased availability of old maps in digital form, of the emergence of user-friendly Geographical Information Systems, and of a heightened awareness of the unique information stored in old maps. As with every source for historical studies, when old maps are georeferenced and information is extracted for historical research, the accuracy and reliability of the geometric and semantic information must be assessed. In this paper, a method based on a series of geometric transformations is presented, which transforms control points of a modern reference map to the coordinate system of an old map. Based on these transformed points, the planimetric and geodetic accuracy of the old map can be computationally analyzed and various visualizations of space deformation can be generated. The results are graphical representations of map distortion, such as distortion grids or displacement vectors, as well as statistical and geodetic measures describing the map geometry (e.g., map scale, rotation angle, and map projection). The visualizations help to assess the geometric accuracy of historical geographical information before using the data for geo-historical studies. The visualizations can also provide valuable information to the map historian about the history of a particular map and its creation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{fleet_georeferencer_2012,
abstract = {Georeferencing of historical maps offers a number of important advantages for libraries: improved retrieval and user interfaces, better understanding of maps, and comparison/overlay with other maps and spatial data. Until recently, georeferencing has involved various relatively time-consuming and costly processes using conventional geographic information system software, and has been infrequently employed by map libraries. The Georeferencer application is a collaborative online project allowing crowdsourced georeferencing of map images. It builds upon a number of related technologies that use existing zoomable images from library web servers. Following a brief review of other approaches and georeferencing software, we describe Georeferencer through its five separate implementations to date: the Moravian Library (Brno), the Nationaal Archief (The Hague), the National Library of Scotland (Edinburgh), the British Library (London), and the Institut Cartografic de Catalunya (Barcelona). The key success factors behind crowdsourcing georeferencing are presented. We then describe future developments and improvements to the Georeferencer technology.},

abstract = {MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

abstract = {Recent growth of geospatial information online has made it possible to access various maps and orthoimagery. Conflating these maps and imagery can create images that combine the visual appeal of imagery with the attribution information from maps. The existing systems require human intervention to conflate maps with imagery. We present a novel approach that utilizes vector datasets as "glue" to automatically conflate street maps with imagery. First, our approach extracts road intersections from imagery and maps as control points. Then, it aligns the two point sets by computing the matched point pattern. Finally, it aligns maps with imagery based on the matched pattern. The experiments show that our approach can conflate various maps with imagery, such that in our experiments on TIGER-maps covering part of St. Louis county, MO, 85.2{\%} of the conflated map roads are within 10.8 m from the actual roads compared to 51.7{\%} for the original and georeferenced TIGER-map roads.},

abstract = {The World of Mapping ISSN: 0008-7041 (Print) 1743-2774 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/ycaj20 The selection of map projections is difficult and confusing for many. This article introduces Projection Wizard, an online map projection selection tool available at projectionwizard.org that helps mapmakers select projections. The user selects the desired distortion property, and the area to be mapped on an interactive web map. Projection Wizard then proposes a projection, along with projection parameters (such as standard parallels). The tool also creates a preview map with the proposed projection, and provides the corresponding projection code in PROJ.4 format, if applicable. The automated selection process is based on John P. Snyder's selection guideline with a few adjustments. This article discusses the automated selection process, and the map projections suggested. Projection Wizard solves the problem of map projection selection for many applications and helps cartographers and GIS users choose appropriate map projections. A common goal when selecting a map projection is to find a projection and projection parameters that minimize dis-tortion of the mapped area. To meet this objective, a map projection has to satisfy the requirements set by the particular purpose of a map (Bugayevskiy and Snyder, 1995). The criteria for selecting a projection include the location of the mapped area, the directional extent of the mapped area, and the required distortion property. In some cases, especially when designing small-scale maps, cartographers are left with a number of projections that meet these requirements. There is a plethora of map projections available for carto-graphers to choose from, and applying the selection criteria is a difficult task (De Genst and Canters, 1996; Finn et al., 2004; Slocum et al., 2009; Snyder, 1993). GIS and mapping software enable less experienced mapmakers to create maps, but the selection criteria for map projections are a mystery to many (De Genst and Canters, 1996; Finn et al., 2004, in press). Often, mapmakers use default projections, e.g., the Plate Carr{\'{e}}e, which is commonly used for distributing geospatial data, or the Mercator pro-jection when creating web maps (Battersby et al., 2014). This paper introduces Projection Wizard, an online map projection selection tool that is available for free at projec-tionwizard.org. The goal of Projection Wizard is to help mapmakers select appropriate map projections and thus create better maps.},

abstract = {Movement data link together space, time, and objects positioned in space and time. They hold valuable and multifaceted information about moving objects, properties of space and time as well as events and processes occurring in space and time. We present a conceptual framework that describes in a systematic and comprehensive way the possible types of information that can be extracted from movement data and on this basis defines the respective types of analytical tasks. Tasks are distinguished according to the type of information they target and according to the level of analysis, which may be elementary (i.e. addressing specific elements of a set) or synoptic (i.e. addressing a set or subsets). We also present a taxonomy of generic analytic techniques, in which the types of tasks are linked to the corresponding classes of techniques that can support fulfilling them. We include techniques from several research fields: visualization and visual analytics, geographic information science, database technology, and data mining. We expect the taxonomy to be valuable for analysts and researchers. Analysts will receive guidance in choosing suitable analytic techniques for their data and tasks. Researchers will learn what approaches exist in different fields and compare or relate them to the approaches they are going to undertake. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
