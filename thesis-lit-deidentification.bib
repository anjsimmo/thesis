abstract = {This thesis contains detailed analysis of Australian Rules football, played in the Australian Football League (AFL). Data from 1295 matches, dating back to 1998, as collected by the League's official information providers, Champion Data, has been used for the analysis as they were the industry partner for the reserach. The quality and detail associated with the data has enabled analysis to be performed that previously would have been impossible. Statistical distributions are fit to scoring events, both on attack and defence, for teams in the competition. It is discovered that the Poisson distribution provides a better approximation of the data than the negative binomial distribution for individual teams. Correlations between scoring events are also analysed with a view to developing a prematch prediction model. Using the results of the exploratory analysis, a static pre-match model that performs better than a model updated at half time, is presented. This model uses negative binomial regression to predict goals and behinds separately for each team and consequently a predicted score. The failure of this model to adapt to dynamic events resulted in models being pursued that could adjust for events as they happened. An eight state global Markov process model is presented that provides an adequate approximation to AFL football with no regard to location of events on the playing field. Transition probabilities are derived for each state using the transaction files collected by Champion Data for matches in 2003 and 2004. This model is then used for post-match applications, including altering play scenarios and calculating the effect of rule changes, as well as dynamically updating match predictions using live match data. It is expected that these applications will be made available to the wider football community over the next couple of seasons. The coding of events by Champion Data according to their location on the field enabled a second model to be developed that calculated transition probabilities by zone. This 18 state zone model improved upon the global model due to the inclusion of more information. The zone approach will be more informative to AFL teams as it gives a clearer indication of the functionality of the attacking, midfield and defensive units, rather than looking on these units as a whole. The zone model was used to replicate the applications of the global model and investigate whether different results were produced. Extra applications were made available with the introduction of the zone model, particularly investigating play strategy in different areas of the ground. Regression models were again developed for predicting match margin at different stages of a match using the transition probabilities up to that stage. The accuracy of these models was good with significant amounts of the variation in final margin explained and this accuracy increased noticeably as a match progressed. The models were used to test the differences in style of play for each team when compared to the competition average. Finally, playing styles of teams were compared for home state games and interstate games to test which transitions differed significantly. The models presented in this thesis provided accurate approximations of AFL football that has not been seen elsewhere. Some of the applications of these models are already being used by AFL clubs and further commercialisation of the applications will take place over the next season with a view to providing detailed mathematical analysis to the AFL industry in years to come.},

abstract = {Today people increasingly have the opportunity to opt-in to "usage-based" automotive insurance programs for reducing insurance premiums. In these programs, participants install devices in their vehicles that monitor their driving behavior, which raises some privacy concerns. Some devices collect fine-grained speed data to monitor driving habits. Companies that use these devices claim that their approach is privacy-preserving because speedometer measurements do not have physical locations. However, we show that with knowledge of the user's home location, as the insurance companies have, speed data is sufficient to discover driving routes and destinations when trip data is collected over a period of weeks. To demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach we applied our algorithm, elastic pathing, to data collected over hundreds of driving trips occurring over several months. With this data and our approach, we were able to predict trip destinations to within 250 meters of ground truth in 10{\%} of the traces and within 500 meters in 20{\%} of the traces. This result, combined with the amount of speed data that is being collected by insurance companies, constitutes a substantial breach of privacy because a person's regular driving pattern can be deduced with repeated examples of the same paths with just a few weeks of monitoring.},

abstract = {Background Injuries to the hamstring are relatively common in professional cricketers (as they are in many team sports) and have increased in incidence in the “T20 era” (introduction of 20-over matches) of cricket since 2006. Methods This study analyzed incidence of hamstring injury in the various elite male match types over a 20-year period (1995–1996 to 2014–2015 seasons). Risk factors for hamstring strain were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis technique. Results There were 276 match time-loss hamstring injuries recorded over a 20-year period at the Australian state or national player level, of which 170 occurred in one of 40,145 player match sets. The overall rate of match onset rate was 22.5 hamstring injuries per 1000 team days. Fast bowling onset injuries were the highest subcategory at a rate of 10.9 injuries per 1000 team days, although batting onset injuries were particularly common in 50-over (one day) international matches. Significant risk factors in logistic regression analysis, in addition to hamstring injury history, were being a fast bowler relative risk (RR) 2.5 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.3–4.5) and playing a match in Australia RR 2.3 (95{\%}CI: 1.3–3.9). Conclusion Fast bowlers suffer more hamstring injuries than other playing roles in cricket, particularly in First Class (multi-day) cricket. Batsmen are more likely to get injured in 50-over (one day) cricket. Playing in Australia (compared to overseas venues) leads to increased risk of hamstring injury.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). The maturing of mobile devices and systems provides an unprecedented opportunity to collect a large amount of real world human motion data at all scales. While the rich knowledge contained in these data sets is valuable in many fields, various types of personally sensitive information can be easily learned from such trajectory data. The ones that are of most concerns are frequent locations, frequent co-locations and trajectory re-identification through spatio-temporal data points. In this work we analyze privacy protection and data utility when trajectory IDs are randomly mixed during co-location events for data collection or publication. We demonstrate through both analyses and simulations that the global geometric shape of each individual trajectory is sufficiently altered such that re-identification via frequent locations, co-location pairs or spatial temporal data points is not possible with high probability. Meanwhile, a decent number of local geometric features of the trajectory data set are still preserved, including the density distribution and local traffic flow.},

abstract = {With the aim of informing sound policy about data sharing and privacy, we describe successful re-identification of patients in an Australian de-identified open health dataset. As in prior studies of similar datasets, a few mundane facts often suffice to isolate an individual. Some people can be identified by name based on publicly available information. Decreasing the precision of the unit-record level data, or perturbing it statistically, makes re-identification gradually harder at a substantial cost to utility. We also examine the value of related datasets in improving the accuracy and confidence of re-identification. Our re-identifications were performed on a 10{\%} sample dataset, but a related open Australian dataset allows us to infer with high confidence that some individuals in the sample have been correctly re-identified. Finally, we examine the combination of the open datasets with some commercial datasets that are known to exist but are not in our possession. We show that they would further increase the ease of re-identification.},

abstract = {Objectives: To develop a physiological performance and anthropometric attribute model to predict Australian Football League draft selection. Design: Cross-sectional observational. Methods: Data was obtained ( n= 4902) from three Under-18 Australian football competitions between 2010 and 2013. Players were allocated into one of the three groups, based on their highest level of selection in their final year of junior football (Australian Football League Drafted, n= 292; National Championship, n= 293; State-level club, n= 4317). Physiological performance (vertical jumps, agility, speed and running endurance) and anthropometric (body mass and height) data were obtained. Hedge's effect sizes were calculated to assess the influence of selection-level and competition on these physical attributes, with logistic regression models constructed to discriminate Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players. Rule induction analysis was undertaken to determine a set of rules for discriminating selection-level. Results: Effect size comparisons revealed a range of small to moderate differences between State-level club players and both other groups for all attributes, with trivial to small differences between Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players noted. Logistic regression models showed multistage fitness test, height and 20. m sprint time as the most important attributes in predicting Draft success. Rule induction analysis showed that players displaying multistage fitness test scores of {\textgreater}14.01 and/or 20. m sprint times of {\textless}2.99 s were most likely to be recruited. Conclusions: High levels of performance in aerobic and/or speed tests increase the likelihood of elite junior Australian football players being recruited to the highest level of the sport.},

abstract = {We study fifteen months of human mobility data for one and a half million individuals and find that human mobility traces are highly unique. In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95{\%} of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

@article{Chen2017,
abstract = {As vehicle maneuver data becomes abundant for assisted or autonomous driving, their implication of privacy invasion/leakage has become an increasing concern. In particular, the surface for fingerprinting a driver will expand significantly if the driver's identity can be linked with the data collected from his mobile or wearable devices which are widely deployed worldwide and have increasing sensing capabilities. In line with this trend, this paper investigates a fast emerging driving data source that has driver's privacy implications. We first show that such privacy threats can be materialized via any mobile device with IMUs (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer). We then present Dri-Fi (Driver Fingerprint), a driving data analytic engine that can fingerprint the driver with vehicle turn(s). Dri-Fi achieves this based on IMUs data taken only during the vehicle's turn(s). Such an approach expands the attack surface significantly compared to existing driver fingerprinting schemes. From this data, Dri-Fi extracts three new features --- acceleration along the end-of-turn axis, its deviation, and the deviation of the yaw rate --- and exploits them to identify the driver. Our extensive evaluation shows that an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver within just one turn with 74.1{\%}, 83.5{\%}, and 90.8{\%} accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle --- respectively. Moreover, with measurements on more than one turn, the adversary can achieve up to 95.3{\%}, 95.4{\%}, and 96.6{\%} accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers, respectively.},
