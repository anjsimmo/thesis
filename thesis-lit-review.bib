@phdthesis{Forbes2006,
abstract = {This thesis contains detailed analysis of Australian Rules football, played in the Australian Football League (AFL). Data from 1295 matches, dating back to 1998, as collected by the League's official information providers, Champion Data, has been used for the analysis as they were the industry partner for the reserach. The quality and detail associated with the data has enabled analysis to be performed that previously would have been impossible. Statistical distributions are fit to scoring events, both on attack and defence, for teams in the competition. It is discovered that the Poisson distribution provides a better approximation of the data than the negative binomial distribution for individual teams. Correlations between scoring events are also analysed with a view to developing a prematch prediction model. Using the results of the exploratory analysis, a static pre-match model that performs better than a model updated at half time, is presented. This model uses negative binomial regression to predict goals and behinds separately for each team and consequently a predicted score. The failure of this model to adapt to dynamic events resulted in models being pursued that could adjust for events as they happened. An eight state global Markov process model is presented that provides an adequate approximation to AFL football with no regard to location of events on the playing field. Transition probabilities are derived for each state using the transaction files collected by Champion Data for matches in 2003 and 2004. This model is then used for post-match applications, including altering play scenarios and calculating the effect of rule changes, as well as dynamically updating match predictions using live match data. It is expected that these applications will be made available to the wider football community over the next couple of seasons. The coding of events by Champion Data according to their location on the field enabled a second model to be developed that calculated transition probabilities by zone. This 18 state zone model improved upon the global model due to the inclusion of more information. The zone approach will be more informative to AFL teams as it gives a clearer indication of the functionality of the attacking, midfield and defensive units, rather than looking on these units as a whole. The zone model was used to replicate the applications of the global model and investigate whether different results were produced. Extra applications were made available with the introduction of the zone model, particularly investigating play strategy in different areas of the ground. Regression models were again developed for predicting match margin at different stages of a match using the transition probabilities up to that stage. The accuracy of these models was good with significant amounts of the variation in final margin explained and this accuracy increased noticeably as a match progressed. The models were used to test the differences in style of play for each team when compared to the competition average. Finally, playing styles of teams were compared for home state games and interstate games to test which transitions differed significantly. The models presented in this thesis provided accurate approximations of AFL football that has not been seen elsewhere. Some of the applications of these models are already being used by AFL clubs and further commercialisation of the applications will take place over the next season with a view to providing detailed mathematical analysis to the AFL industry in years to come.},

abstract = {The optimal physical preparation of elite soccer (association football) players has become an indispensable part of the professional game, especially due to the increased physical demands of match-play. The monitoring of players' work rate profiles during competition is now feasible through computer-aided motion analysis. Traditional methods of motion analysis were extremely labour intensive and were largely restricted to university-based research projects. Recent technological developments have meant that sophisticated systems, capable of quickly recording and processing the data of all players' physical contributions throughout an entire match, are now being used in elite club environments. In recognition of the important role that motion analysis now plays as a tool for measuring the physical performance of soccer players, this review critically appraises various motion analysis methods currently employed in elite soccer and explores research conducted using these methods. This review therefore aims to increase the awareness of both practitioners and researchers of the various motion analysis systems available, and identify practical implications of the established body of knowledge, while highlighting areas that require further exploration.},

@article{Cervone2016,
abstract = {Basketball games evolve continuously in space and time as players constantly interact with their teammates, the opposing team, and the ball. However, current analyses of basketball outcomes rely on discretized summaries of the game that reduce such interactions to tallies of points, assists, and similar events. In this paper, we propose a framework for using optical player tracking data to estimate, in real time, the expected number of points obtained by the end of a possession. This quantity, called $\backslash$textit{\{}expected possession value{\}} (EPV), derives from a stochastic process model for the evolution of a basketball possession; we model this process at multiple levels of resolution, differentiating between continuous, infinitesimal movements of players, and discrete events such as shot attempts and turnovers. Transition kernels are estimated using hierarchical spatiotemporal models that share information across players while remaining computationally tractable on very large data sets. In addition to estimating EPV, these models reveal novel insights on players' decision-making tendencies as a function of their spatial strategy.},

@article{Grunz2009,
abstract = {Meanwhile, not a lack of data is the bottle neck of computer based game analysis but – quite the contrary – the huge amount of them: Data can be recorded automatically in high space and time resolution, resulting in a high percentage of irrelevant data hiding the real information. Trainers are experienced in filtering the most meaningful patterns out of those lots of data but then often miss methods or tools for further systematic analyses. The Neural Network-approach follows the trainers' way of pattern recognition, combining it with computer based methods of complex pattern analysis. The contribution demonstrates exemplarily how it works: In a pre-processing the players' positions are grouped to constellations, e.g. representing offence and defence groups. After the net training, the neurons of the net correspond to typical constellation, and trajectories of the neurons represent time-depending processes of the game. The trajectories themselves are then taken as objects of a second level net based analysis, where, by semantic calibration, types of trajectories are mapped to tactical activities – e.g. short or long attacks on the right or the left side. Finally, as an outlook, the second level network not only represents the given tactical dynamics of the game but can be taken for simulating new ones: Instead of just watching, which neuron is activated by a current tactical activity, an alternate neuron can be selected and fed into a game simulator to see what happens if tactics is changed temporarily.

abstract = {This study reports a stochastic (Markov) model for squash which uses empirical data to transit event states on a shot by shot basis. This offers more information than traditional models with regard to how points were won or lost and the potential for predicting future athletic performance from a priori observation. The predictive capacity of the model, however, is presently restricted because the observed behaviors (shots) and associated outcomes (winners, errors and lets) are statistically variant (p {\textless} .25). A player does not produce a consistent athletic response to the same preceding condition when competing against different opponents, although it is unclear at present whether this observation is a function of the particular analysis employed. Nevertheless, the modeling of athletic behavior is a way to search for critical data which underpin competitive sport performance.},

@phdthesis{Ngo2012,
abstract = {My dissertation examines a new form of fandom, the advanced statistical analysis of professional American baseball. These fans, called Sabermetricians use advanced statistical techniques to analyze baseball players and strategies. This analysis, known as Sabermetrics allows these fans to develop an identity as experts which provide them with a cache of cultural capital. However, their conclusions also alienate them from the baseball establishment, as their conclusions often run counter to the conventional wisdom of baseball. The disagreement over how to analyze baseball caused a public crisis in baseball as well known figures openly criticized the work of Sabermetricians. This debate about the legitimacy of this new knowledge and what it means for how consumers of culture participate in the production of culture makes Sabermetricians and Sabermetrics a compelling subject for sociological inquiry. My research focuses on both the individual Sabermetricians and the conflict between Sabermetricians and the baseball establishment. Using interviews with 46 Sabermetricians, baseball franchise executives, and baseball journalists, my study seeks to understand the how and why this unique fan movement emerged, and how Sabermetricians make meaning in their own lives and make new knowledge that they hope to be integrated into existing thought. My project will also examine the strategies that these actors use to deal with the tension that their identity as "stats geeks" creates within their own lives as they interact with the various actors in the realm of sports fandom. My findings highlight the importance of competing discourses of masculinity in structuring the proceses of how knowledge creation as well as how knowledge is debated, and used in maintaining position within the masculine hierarchy of sports. This work refines the current work and offers new insights to the study of popular culture, fandom, sports, and masculinity.},

abstract = {Prozone{\textregistered} is a new computerised video system that allows the tracking of many individuals performing a sporting activity. The aim of this study was to validate the Prozone{\textregistered} measurement system when measuring displacement velocities on a football pitch. Six male, recreationally active, subjects participated in the study. The subjects performed a series of runs in a straight line and different directions. The following runs were performed and tracked with the Prozone{\textregistered} system: 60m runs, 50m curved runs (30m straight, 20m angled) at different speeds (7 km/h, 11 km/h, 14 km/h, 19 km/h, and 23 km/h), one maximal sprint of 15m and a 20m sprint with a 90 degree turn (10m straight, 10 m left or right) in different zones of the Old Trafford and Reebook Stadiums. The subjects performed the 60m and 50m curved runs at a predetermined pace with an audio velocity control. For the short distances, the subjects were asked to run as fast as possible. For all runs, timing gates data were compared to tracking data measured with Prozone {\textregistered}. The average velocity recorded by the Prozone {\textregistered} system during the paced runs of 60m and 50m showed an excellent correlation (r = 0.999; Total error 0.05, Limits of agreement 0.12) with the average velocity measured by timing gates. Similar correlation (r = 0.970; Total error 0.23, Limits of agreement 0.85) was recorded during the maximal 15m sprint and during the maximal 20m sprint with right or left turns (r = 0.960; Total error 0.05, Limits of agreement 0.12). The results of this study show that Prozone{\textregistered} represents a valid motion analysis system for analysing movement patterns of footballers on a football pitch.},

@article{Gastin2013,
abstract = {Objectives: To describe and quantify the frequency, velocity and acceleration at impact during tackling in Australian football using a combination of video and athlete tracking technology. Design: Quasi-experimental. Methods: Data was collected from twenty professional Australian Football League players during four in-season matches. All tackles made by the player and those against the player were video-coded and time stamped at the point of contact and then subjectively categorised into low, medium and high intensity impact groups. Peak GPS and acceleration data were identified at the point of contact. Two-way analysis of variance was used to assess differences (p{\textless}0.05) between tackle type (made and against) and tackle intensity. Results: A total of 173 tackles made and 179 tackles against were recorded. Significant differences were found between all tackle intensity groups. Peak velocity was significantly greater in high (19.5±6.1kmh-1) compared to medium (13.4±5.8kmh-1) and low intensity (11.3±5.0kmh-1) tackles. Peak Player Load™, a modified vector magnitude of tri-axial acceleration, was significantly greater in high (7.5±1.7a.u.) compared to medium (4.9±1.5a.u.) and low intensity (4.0±1.3a.u.) tackles. Conclusions: High intensity tackles, although less frequent, are significantly greater in speed of movement immediately prior to contact and in the resultant impact acceleration compared to tackles of lower intensity. Differences in accelerometer data between tackles observed to be progressively greater in intensity suggest a level of ecological validity and provide preliminary support for the use of accelerometers to assess impact forces in contact invasion sports. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.},

One or more cameras (11, 12, 14) are situated so as to cover the entire playing area (10) of the event. The output of at least one of these cameras is provided to a digital image processor (22), which tracks the movements of the images, or silhouettes, of players in the camera images. By employing multiple camera views of the same playing area, the tracking processor can, in most cases, resolve ambiguities arising from overlaps in any one view. For the remaining, unresolved, cases, one or more human operators, provided with the same or similar camera views, are employed, through an interactive interface. The operators are provided with apparatus (30) for identifying players, through a query/response method, as requested by the tracking processor (22). The operators also provide initial player identification at the start of the event, and following breaks in the action, using the same apparatus. A varient system is described wherein the player identification task of the operator is performed, instead, by electronic tracking devices, such as radio transmitters, in conjunction with off-field electronics (60, 61, 67, 68), incorporating telemetry and triangulation in order to obtain identity and approximate position of all game participants.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a low-cost wireless sensor network platform, called wireless ad hoc system for positioning (WASP), that has been developed for high-accuracy localization and tracking. This platform uses the time of arrival (TOA) of beacon signals periodically transmitted by the nodes at known times for localization. The system was designed to have a unique tradeoff between hardware complexity and processing complexity to provide high accuracy at minimal cost in complex radio propagation environments. To enable the system to perform well in realistic environments, it was also necessary to develop novel extensions to existing algorithms for the measurement of TOA, localization, and tracking. In this paper, we describe the architecture, hardware, and algorithms of WASP and present results based on field trials conducted in different radio propagation environments. The results show that WASP achieves a ranging accuracy of 0.15 m outdoors and 0.5 m indoors when around 12 anchor nodes are used. These accuracies are achieved with operating range of up to 200 m outdoors and 30 m indoors. This compares favorably to other published results for systems operating in realistic environments.},

abstract = {An exponential smoothing technique operating on the margins of victory was used to predict the results of Australian Rules football matches for a Melbourne daily newspaper from 1981-86 and again for a competitor in 1991-92. An initial 'quick and dirty' program used only a factor for team ability and a common home ground advantage to predict winning margins. Probabilities of winning were accumulated to predict a final ladder, with a simulation to predict chances of teams finishing in any position. Changes to the competition forced a more complicated approach, and the current version uses several parameters which allow for ability, team/ground interaction, team interaction, and a tendency for team ability to regress towards the mean between seasons. A power method is used to place greater weight on the errors in closer matches, and errors across the win-lose boundary. While simple methods were used originally, the Hooke and Jeeves method was used in optimizing the parameters of the current model. Both the original model and the improved version performed at the level of expert tipsters.},

Overall findings show that GPS is a useful tool to augment our understanding of physical activity by providing the context (location) of the activity and used together with Geographical Information Systems can provide some insight into how people interact with the environment. However, no studies have shown that GPS alone is a reliable and valid measure of physical activity.},

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability.The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {New Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers allow now to measure a location on earth at high frequency (5Hz) with a centimetric precision using phase differential positioning method. We studied whether such technique was accurate enough to retrieve basic parameters of human locomotion. Eight subjects walked on an athletics track at four different imposed step frequencies (70-130steps/min) plus a run at free pace. Differential carrier phase localization between a fixed base station and the mobile antenna mounted on the walking person was calculated. In parallel, a triaxial accelerometer, attached to the low back, recorded body accelerations. The different parameters were averaged for 150 consecutive steps of each run for each subject (total of 6000 steps analyzed). We observed a perfect correlation between average step duration measured by accelerometer and by GPS (r=0.9998, N=40). Two important parameters for the calculation of the external work of walking were also analyzed, namely the vertical lift of the trunk and the velocity variation per step. For an average walking speed of 4.0km/h, average vertical lift and velocity variation were, respectively, 4.8cm and 0.60km/h. The average intra-individual step-to-step variability at a constant speed, which includes GPS errors and the biological gait style variation, were found to be 24.5{\%} (coefficient of variation) for vertical lift and 44.5{\%} for velocity variation. It is concluded that GPS technique can provide useful biomechanical parameters for the analysis of an unlimited number of strides in an unconstrained free-living environment.

This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

abstract = {Subject Terms: *CLASSIFICATION *FORECASTING *THEORY CRITICAL thinking EXPLANATION KNOWLEDGE, Theory of INFORMATION resources TAXONOMY THEORY {\&} practice Abstract: The aim of this research essay is to examine the structural nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different view points. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{gramacy_estimating_2012,
abstract = {We present a regularized logistic regression model for evaluating player contributions in hockey. The traditional metric for this purpose is the plus-minus statistic, which allocates a single unit of credit (for or against) to each player on the ice for a goal. However, plus-minus scores measure only the marginal effect of players, do not account for sample size, and provide a very noisy estimate of performance. We investigate a related regression problem: what does each player on the ice contribute, beyond aggregate team performance and other factors, to the odds that a given goal was scored by their team? Due to the large- p (number of players) and imbalanced design setting of hockey analysis, a major part of our contribution is a careful treatment of prior shrinkage in model estimation. We showcase two recently developed techniques – for posterior maximization or simulation – that make such analysis feasible. Each approach is accompanied with publicly available software and we include the simple commands used in our analysis. Our results show that most players do not stand out as measurably strong (positive or negative) contributors. This allows the stars to really shine, reveals diamonds in the rough overlooked by earlier analyses, and argues that some of the highest paid players in the league are not making contributions worth their expense.},

@article{oshaughnessy_possession_2006,
abstract = {In sports like Australian Rules football and soccer, teams must battle to achieve possession of the ball in sufficient space to make optimal use of it. Ultimately the teams need to score, and to do that the ball must be brought into the area in front of goal – the place where the defence usually concentrates on shutting down space and opportunity time. Coaches would like to quantify the trade-offs between contested play in good positions and uncontested play in less promising positions, in order to inform their decisionmaking about where to put their players, and when to gamble on sending the ball to a contest rather than simply maintain possession. To evaluate football strategies, Champion Data has collected the on-ground locations of all 350,000 possessions and stoppages in the past two seasons of AFL (2004, 2005). By following each chain of play through to the next score, we can now reliably estimate the scoreboard “equity” of possessing the ball at any location, and measure the effect of having sufficient time to dispose of it effectively. As expected, winning the ball under physical pressure (through a “hard ball get”) is far more difficult to convert into a score than winning it via a mark. We also analyse some equity gradients to show how getting the ball 20 metres closer to goal is much more important in certain areas of the ground than in others. We conclude by looking at the choices faced by players in possession wanting to maximise their likelihood of success.},

abstract = {The aims of this paper are to examine the application of performance indicators in diþ erent sports and, using the diþ erent structural de{\textregistered} nitions of games, to make general recommendations about the use and application of these indicators. Formal games are classi{\textregistered} ed into three categories: net and wall games, invasion games, and striking and {\textregistered} elding games. The diþ erent types of sports are also sub-categorized by the rules of scoring and ending the respective matches. These classes are analysed further, to enable de{\textregistered} nition of useful performance indicators and to examine similarities and diþ erences in the analysis of the diþ erent categories of game. The indices of performance are sub-categorized into general match indicators, tactical indicators, technical indicators and biomechanical indicators. Diþ erent research examples and the accuracy of their presentation are discussed. We conclude that, to enable a full and objective interpretation of the data from the analysis of a performance, comparisons of data are vital. In addition, any analysis of the distribution of actions across the playing surface should also be presented normalized, or non-dimensionalized, to the total distribution of actions across the area. Other normalizations of performance indicators should also be used more widely in conjunction with the accepted forms of data analysis. Finally, we recommend that biomechanists should pay more attention to games to enrich the analysis of performance in these sports.},

We present a system for acquiring motions almost anywhere. This wearable system gathers ultrasonic time-of-flight and inertial measurements with a set of inexpensive miniature sensors worn on the garment. After recording, the information is combined using an Extended Kalman Filter to reconstruct joint configurations of a body. Experimental results show that even motions that are traditionally difficult to acquire are recorded with ease within their natural settings. Although our prototype does not reliably recover the global transformation, we show that the resulting motions are visually similar to the original ones, and that the combined acoustic and intertial system reduces the drift commonly observed in purely inertial systems. Our final results suggest that this system could become a versatile input device for a variety of augmented-reality applications.},

abstract = {The aim of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of two video-based perceptual training approaches designed to improve the anticipatory skills of junior tennis players. Players were assigned equally to an explicit learning group, an implicit learning group, a placebo group or a control group. A progressive temporal occlusion paradigm was used to examine, before and after training, the ability of the players to predict the direction of an opponent's service in an in-vivo on-court setting. The players responded either through hitting a return stroke or making a verbal prediction of stroke direction. Results revealed that the implicit learning group, whose training required them to predict serve speed direction while viewing temporally occluded video footage of the return-of-serve scenario, significantly improved their prediction accuracy after the training intervention. However, this training effect dissipated after a 32 day unfilled retention interval. The explicit learning group, who received instructions about the specific aspects of the pre-contact service kinematics that are informative with respect to service direction, did not demonstrate any significant performance improvements after the intervention. This, together with the absence of any significant improvements for the placebo and control groups, demonstrated that the improvement observed for the implicit learning group was not a consequence of either expectancy or familiarity effects.},

Position and sensor data are captured with high precision and at a high level of detail. Moreover, the position data is automatically analyzed and interpreted from a sports science point of view and presented in a graphical user interface to players, teams and coaches. As an example, a standardized performance test for footballers of the German football association DFB is implemented and presented here. Thus, many disciplines from radio frequency and communication technologies, media en- gineering, sports medicine and sports science as well as valuable input from sports professionals contributed to this research work.

abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) technology was made possible after the invention of the atomic clock. The first suggestion that GPS could be used to assess the physical activity of humans followed some 40 y later. There was a rapid uptake of GPS technology, with the literature concentrating on validation studies and the measurement of steady-state movement. The first attempts were made to validate GPS for field sport applications in 2006. While GPS has been validated for applications for team sports, some doubts continue to exist on the appropriateness of GPS for measuring short high-velocity movements. Thus, GPS has been applied extensively in Australian football, cricket, hockey, rugby union and league, and soccer. There is extensive information on the activity profile of athletes from field sports in the literature stemming from GPS, and this includes total distance covered by players and distance in velocity bands. Global positioning systems have also been applied to detect fatigue in matches, identify periods of most intense play, different activity profiles by position, competition level, and sport. More recent research has integrated GPS data with the physical capacity or fitness test score of athletes, game-specific tasks, or tactical or strategic information. The future of GPS analysis will involve further miniaturization of devices, longer battery life, and integration of other inertial sensor data to more effectively quantify the effort of athletes.},

abstract = {Basketball is a game of decisions; at any moment, a player can change the character of a possession by choosing to pass, dribble, or shoot. The current state of basketball analytics, however, provides no way to quantitatively evaluate the vast majority of decisions that players make, as most metrics are driven by events that occur at or near the end of a possession, such as points, turnovers, and assists. We propose a framework for using plater-tracking data to assign a point value to each moment of a possession by computing how many points the offense is expected to score by the end of the possession, a quantity we call expected possession value (EPV). EPV allows analysts to evaluate every decision made during a basketball game - whether it is to pass, dribble, or shoot - opening the door for a multitude of new metrics and analyses of basketball that quantify value in terms of points. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for estimating EPV, present results of EPV computations performed using player-tracking data from the 2012-2013 season, adn provide several examples of EPV-derived metrics that answer real basketball questions.},

This study investigated the characteristics of ball possession, passing, and attacking behaviour of world-class teams using association rule mining techniques and a visualization technique based on the ISOPAR method. We analysed the women's preliminary round matches of Pool A of the 2008 Olympic Games. The results reveal a) that teams tend to carry the ball on the right side of the pitch, and b) that ball possession that resulted in goal shots were more likely to be neutral or left side, although left sided plays were less frequent overall.},

abstract = {By analysing past and current work in racket sports, it was found that notational analysis of sport could be systematically analysed by using these delimitations. The development of analysis and technology in the analysis of racket sports The technological developments in notational analysis have inevitably lagged those in the applied computing technology environment. Application of feedback in racket sports The main applied areas of objective feedback were found to be: Tactical evaluation, Technical evaluation, Movement analysis, Databases and modelling, Performance profiling The definition of profiles is much less a matter of guesswork because of methodological advances. Reliability The methods of measuring and calculating the reliability of non-parametric data has grown with research over the last few years. Areas of Research and Support More research in modelling in performance analysis is vital as we extend our knowledge and databases into those exciting areas of prediction. It is clear from these analyses of the on-going research and development work in racket sports, that the working notational analyst must have a broad set of skills and be prepared to maintain and extend those skills just as the research in this area develops the knowledge base.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test whether the Global Positioning System (GPS) could be potentially useful to assess the velocity of walking and running in humans. SUBJECT: A young man was equipped with a GPS receptor while walking running and cycling at various velocity on an athletic track. The speed of displacement assessed by GPS, was compared to that directly measured by chronometry (76 tests). RESULTS: In walking and running conditions (from 2-20 km/h) as well as cycling conditions (from 20-40 km/h), there was a significant relationship between the speed assessed by GPS and that actually measured (r = 0.99, P {\textless} 0.0001) with little bias in the prediction of velocity. The overall error of prediction (s.d. of difference) averaged +/-0.8 km/h. CONCLUSION: The GPS technique appears very promising for speed assessment although the relative accuracy at walking speed is still insufficient for research purposes. It may be improved by using differential GPS measurement.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the network of passes among the players of the Spanish team during the last FIFA World Cup 2010, where they emerged as the champion, with the objective of explaining the results obtained from the behavior at the complex network level. The team is considered a network with players as nodes and passes as (directed) edges. A temporal analysis of the resulting passes network is also done, looking at the number of passes, length of the chain of passes, and to network measures such as player centrality and clustering coefficient. Results of the last three matches (the decisive ones) indicate that the clustering coefficient of the pass network remains high, indicating the elaborate style of the Spanish team. The effectiveness of the opposing team in negating the Spanish game is reflected in the change of several network measures over time, most importantly in drops of the clustering coefficient and passing length/speed, as well as in their being able in removing the most talented players from the central positions of the network. Spain's ability to restore their combinative game and move the focus of the game to offensive positions and talented players is shown to tilt the balance in favor of the Spanish team.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of Global positioning system (GPS) technology in team sport permits measurement of player position, velocity, and movement patterns. GPS provides scope for better understanding of the specific and positional physiological demands of team sport and can be used to design training programs that adequately prepare athletes for competition with the aim of optimizing on-field performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the depth and scope of reported GPS and microtechnology measures used within individual sports in order to present the contemporary and emerging themes of GPS application within team sports.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic review of the application of GPS technology in team sports was conducted. We systematically searched electronic databases from earliest record to June 2012. Permutations of key words included GPS; male and female; age 12-50 years; able-bodied; and recreational to elite competitive team sports.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The 35 manuscripts meeting the eligibility criteria included 1,276 participants (age 11.2-31.5 years; 95 {\%} males; 53.8 {\%} elite adult athletes). The majority of manuscripts reported on GPS use in various football codes: Australian football league (AFL; n = 8), soccer (n = 7), rugby union (n = 6), and rugby league (n = 6), with limited representation in other team sports: cricket (n = 3), hockey (n = 3), lacrosse (n = 1), and netball (n = 1). Of the included manuscripts, 34 (97 {\%}) detailed work rate patterns such as distance, relative distance, speed, and accelerations, with only five (14.3 {\%}) reporting on impact variables. Activity profiles characterizing positional play and competitive levels were also described. Work rate patterns were typically categorized into six speed zones, ranging from 0 to 36.0 km{\textperiodcentered}h⁻¹, with descriptors ranging from walking to sprinting used to identify the type of activity mainly performed in each zone. With the exception of cricket, no standardized speed zones or definitions were observed within or between sports. Furthermore, speed zone criteria often varied widely within (e.g. zone 3 of AFL ranged from 7 to 16 km{\textperiodcentered}h⁻¹) and between sports (e.g. zone 3 of soccer ranged from 3.0 to {\textless}13 km{\textperiodcentered}h⁻¹ code). Activity descriptors for a zone also varied widely between sports (e.g. zone 4 definitions ranged from jog, run, high velocity, to high-intensity run). Most manuscripts focused on the demands of higher intensity efforts (running and sprint) required by players. Body loads and impacts, also summarized into six zones, showed small variations in descriptions, with zone criteria based upon grading systems provided by GPS manufacturers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This systematic review highlights that GPS technology has been used more often across a range of football codes than across other team sports. Work rate pattern activities are most often reported, whilst impact data, which require the use of microtechnology sensors such as accelerometers, are least reported. There is a lack of consistency in the definition of speed zones and activity descriptors, both within and across team sports, thus underscoring the difficulties encountered in meaningful comparisons of the physiological demands both within and between team sports. A consensus on definitions of speed zones and activity descriptors within sports would facilitate direct comparison of the demands within the same sport. Meta-analysis from systematic review would also be supported. Standardization of speed zones between sports may not be feasible due to disparities in work rate pattern activities.},

abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) technology was made possible after the invention of the atomic clock. The first suggestion that GPS could be used to assess the physical activity of humans followed some 40 y later. There was a rapid uptake of GPS technology, with the literature concentrating on validation studies and the measurement of steady-state movement. The first attempts were made to validate GPS for field sport applications in 2006. While GPS has been validated for applications for team sports, some doubts continue to exist on the appropriateness of GPS for measuring short high-velocity movements. Thus, GPS has been applied extensively in Australian football, cricket, hockey, rugby union and league, and soccer. There is extensive information on the activity profile of athletes from field sports in the literature stemming from GPS, and this includes total distance covered by players and distance in velocity bands. Global positioning systems have also been applied to detect fatigue in matches, identify periods of most intense play, different activity profiles by position, competition level, and sport. More recent research has integrated GPS data with the physical capacity or fitness test score of athletes, game-specific tasks, or tactical or strategic information. The future of GPS analysis will involve further miniaturization of devices, longer battery life, and integration of other inertial sensor data to more effectively quantify the effort of athletes.},

abstract = {Sports scientists require a thorough understanding of the energy demands of sports and physical activities so that optimal training strategies and game simulations can be constructed. A range of techniques has been used to both directly assess and estimate the physiological and biochemical changes during competition. A fundamental approach to understanding the contribution of the energy systems in physical activity has involved the use of time-motion studies. A number of tools have been used from simple pen and paper methods, the use of video recordings, to sophisticated electronic tracking devices. Depending on the sport, there may be difficulties in using electronic tracking devices because of concerns of player safety. This paper assesses two methods currently used to measure player movement patterns during competition: (1) global positioning technology (GPS) and (2) a computer-based tracking (CBT) system that relies on a calibrated miniaturised playing field and mechanical movements of the tracker. A range of ways was used to determine the validity and reliability of these methods for tracking Australian footballers for distance covered during games. Comparisons were also made between these methods. The results indicate distances measured using CBT overestimated the actual values (measured with a calibrated trundle wheel) by an average of about 5.8{\%}. The GPS system overestimated the actual values by about 4.8{\%}. Distances measured using CBT in experienced hands were as accurate as the GPS technology. Both systems showed relatively small errors in true distances. {\textcopyright} 2006 Sports Medicine Australia.},

The 3 intervention groups improved from pre- to posttest compared with a control group (n = 8), highlighting the benefits of perceptual-cognitive training. Participants in the explicit (n = 8) and guided discovery (n = 10) groups improved their performance during acquisition at a faster rate than did the discovery learning (n = 7) group. However, the explicit group showed a significant decrement in performance when tested under anxiety provoking conditions compared with the guided discovery and discovery learning groups.

abstract = {Multi-agent teamwork is critical in a large number of agent applications, including training, education, virtual enterprises and collective robotics. The complex interactions of agents in a team as well as with other agents make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand and analyze agent-team behavior. It has thus become increasingly important to develop tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors. However, the problem of automated team analysis is largely unaddressed in previous work. In this article, we identify several key constraints faced by team analysts. Most fundamentally, multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. In addition, effective ways of presenting the analysis to humans is critical and the presentation techniques depend on the model being presented. Finally, analysis should be independent of underlying team architecture and implementation. We also demonstrate an approach to addressing these constraints by building an automated team analyst called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC acquires multiple, heterogeneous team models via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. ISAAC also provides feedback on team improvement in two novel ways: (i) It supports principled what-if reasoning about possible agent improvements; (ii) It allows the user to compare different teams based on their patterns of interactions. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in two domains: (i) RoboCup Soccer; (ii) software agent teams participating in a simulated evacuation scenario. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup '99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award. In the evacuation domain, ISAAC was used to analyze patterns of message exchanges among software agents, illustrating the generality of ISAAC's techniques. We present detailed algorithms and experimental results from ISAAC's application.},

@article{Duarte2012,
abstract = {Significant criticisms have emerged on the way that collective behaviours in team sports have been traditionally evaluated. A major recommendation has been for future research and practice to focus on the interpersonal relationships developed between team players during performance. Most research has typically investigated team game performance in subunits (attack or defence), rather than considering the interactions of performers within the whole team. In this paper, we offer the view that team performance analysis could benefit from the adoption of biological models used to explain how repeated interactions between grouping individuals scale to emergent social collective behaviours. We highlight the advantages of conceptualizing sports teams as functional integrated 'super-organisms' and discuss innovative measurement tools, which might be used to capture the superorganismic properties of sports teams. These tools are suitable for revealing the idiosyncratic collective behaviours underlying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of different sports teams, particularly their coordination of labour and the most frequent channels of communication and patterns of interaction between team players. The principles and tools presented here can serve as the basis for novel approaches and applications of performance analysis devoted to understanding sports teams as cohesive, functioning, high-order organisms exhibiting their own peculiar behavioural patterns.},

@article{Braham2018,
abstract = {We construct player-based complex network models of Australian football teams for the 2014 Australian Football League season; modelling the passes between players as weighted, directed edges. We show that analysis of these measures can give an insight into the underlying structure and strategy of Australian football teams, quantitatively distinguishing different playing styles. The relationships observed between network properties and match outcomes suggest that successful teams exhibit well-connected passing networks with the passes distributed between all 22 players as evenly as possible. Linear regression models of team scores and match margins show significant improvements in R2 and Bayesian information criterion when network measures are added to models that use conventional measures, demonstrating that network analysis measures contain useful, extra information. Several measures, particularly the mean betweenness centrality, are shown to be useful in predicting the outcomes of future matches, suggesting they measure some aspect of the intrinsic strength of teams. In addition, several local centrality measures are shown to be useful in analysing individual players' differing contributions to the team's structure. Australian football was developed in the late 1850s as a way for cricketers to keep fit in the winter. It is a fast-paced, free-flowing game that is currently one of the most popular sports in Australia. Its highest level of competition, the Australian Football League (AFL), is the most attended and viewed sports league in the country. An Australian football team can be thought of as a complex system, with the players interacting through passes. The lack of rigid positioning or restrictions on player movement make it a good candidate for modelling passing structures with player-based complex networks. In this work, we develop a set of context-appropriate network properties for analysing such networks and demonstrate their relationship to team and player performance. By analysing the relationships between particular network properties and match outcomes, we can suggest network characteristics that are common to successful teams. At present, common statistical analysis of AFL matches is based around the number of times particular events occur. For example, the number of times a particular player passed the ball or the number of turnovers committed by each team. Network analysis has the potential to provide measures that give a more quantitative picture of the intrinsic dynamics and strategies that lead to these events occurring. Considering a player's node within their team's network, we create quantitative measures of a player's role within their team's passing structure; capturing interactions with other players rather than simply counting the number of effective actions performed. Although the results themselves are naturally specific to the 2014 AFL season, the relationships observed can be seen as a proof of concept that such network analysis methods could be used to provide useful information about Australian football, or indeed extended to other team settings.},

The results of average covered distances (±SD) in the 1st and 2 nd halves were 2199(±230) and 2453(±214). The results of covered distances and the velocities allow individual and collective analyses of the players by the team staff.

Recent research suggest that team work is of crucial importance to cutting-edge scientific research, but little is known about how teamwork leads to greater creativity. Indeed, for many team activities, it is not even clear how to assign credit to individual team members. Remarkably, at least in the context of sports, there is usually a broad consensus on who are the top performers and on what qualifies as an outstanding performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to determine how individual features can be quantified, and as a test bed for other team-based human activities, we analyze the performance of players in the European Cup 2008 soccer tournament. We develop a network approach that provides a powerful quantification of the contributions of individual players and of overall team performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesize that generalizations of our approach could be useful in other contexts where quantification of the contributions of individual team members is important.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the kinematics of baseball pitchers who participated in the 1996 XXVI Centennial Olympic Games. Two synchronized video cameras operating at 120 Hz were used to video 48 pitchers from Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Cuba, Italy, Korea, Nicaragua and the USA. All pitchers were analysed while throwing the fastball pitch. Twenty-one kinematic parameters were measured at lead foot contact, during the arm cocking and arm acceleration phases, and at the instant of ball release. These parameters included stride length, foot angle and foot placement; shoulder abduction, shoulder horizontal adduction and shoulder external rotation; knee and elbow flexion; upper torso, shoulder internal rotation and elbow extension angular velocities; forward and lateral trunk tilt; and ball speed. A one-way analysis of variance (P {\textless} 0.01) was used to assess kinematic differences. Shoulder horizontal adduction and shoulder external rotation at lead foot contact and ball speed at the instant of ball release were significantly different among countries. The greater shoulder horizontal abduction observed in Cuban pitchers at lead foot contact is thought to be an important factor in the generation of force throughout the arm cocking and arm acceleration phases, and may in part explain why Cuban pitchers generated the greatest ball release speed. We conclude that pitching kinematics are similar among baseball pitchers from different countries.},
