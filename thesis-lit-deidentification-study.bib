abstract = {Computer scientists have recently undermined our faith in the privacy- protecting power of anonymization, the name for techniques that protect the privacy of individuals in large databases by deleting information like names and social security numbers. These scientists have demonstrated that they can often “reidentify” or “deanonymize” individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention. We must respond to the surprising failure of anonymization, and this Article provides the tools to do so.},

abstract = {The generic term “game style” is often used to infer a way a team has performed or a playing pattern that has developed. However, this concept has not previously been measured. This study developed a generic model to measure game styles among field sports. Specifically, game styles of 6 Australian Football League (AFL) teams were assessed using 12 performance indicators, during the 2015 season. These variables were allocated to one of five “moments” of play: established offence/defence, transition to offence/defence and set pieces. A game style plot was generated using z-scores to show each team's deviance from the sample average. Among the six AFL teams, there were many common features of game style indicating teams were trying to play in similar ways. Plots identified specific moments of relatively weaker or stronger performance, and hence areas for improvement. Correlation analysis demonstrated significant correlations between the total sum of z-scores across moments and success (premiership position $\rho$ = −1, p = .025; and scoring percentage $\rho$ = .943, p = .035). Game style plots are easy to interpret, can highlight areas of concern in specific play periods or phases, and help marry training drills with deficiencies in various moments.},

abstract = {Humans have analyzed negative scenarios ever since they first sat around Ice Age campfires debating the dangers of catching a woolly rhinoceros: "What if it turns and charges us before it falls into the pit?" A more recent scenario is "What if the hackers launch a denial-of-service attack?" Modern systems engineers can employ a misuse case, the negative form of a use case, to document and analyze such scenarios. A misuse case is simply a use case from the point of view of an actor hostile to the system under design. Misuse cases have many possible applications and interact with use cases in interesting and helpful ways. The paper discusses the elicitation of safety requirements from failure cases and considers the interplay of design, functional, and nonfunctional requirements.},

abstract = {Background: Explicit patient consent requirements in privacy laws can have a negative impact on health research, leading to selection bias and reduced recruitment. Often legislative requirements to obtain consent are waived if the information collected or disclosed is de-identified. Objective: The authors developed and empirically evaluated a new globally optimal de-identification algorithm that satisfies the k-anonymity criterion and that is suitable for health datasets. Design: Authors compared OLA (Optimal Lattice Anonymization) empirically to three existing k-anonymity algorithms, Datafly, Samarati, and Incognito, on six public, hospital, and registry datasets for different values of k and suppression limits. Measurement: Three information loss metrics were used for the comparison: precision, discernability metric, and non-uniform entropy. Each algorithm's performance speed was also evaluated. Results: The Datafly and Samarati algorithms had higher information loss than OLA and Incognito; OLA was consistently faster than Incognito in finding the globally optimal de-identification solution. Conclusions: For the de-identification of health datasets, OLA is an improvement on existing k-anonymity algorithms in terms of information loss and performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 J Am Med Inform Assoc.},

Preseason workload volume and high-risk periods for noncontact injury across multiple Australian Football League seasons. J Strength Cond Res 31(7): 1821-1829, 2017-The purpose of this study was to assess the association between preseason workloads and noncontact injury risk in Australian football players. Individual player injury data were recorded over 4 full seasons (2012-15) from one professional club. Noncontact injury incidence (per 1,000 "on legs" field training and game hours) was compared across the preseason, precompetition, and in-season phases to determine relative noncontact injury risk. Preseason workloads (global positioning system-derived total distance run and sprint distance) and individual (fixed) injury risk factors (age, previous injury history) were incorporated into the analysis. A generalized estimating equation with a binary logistic function modeled potential risk factors with noncontact injury for selected periods across the annual cycle. Odds ratios were calculated to determine the relative injury risk. The (preseason) precompetition phase (19.1 injuries per 1,000 hours) and (in-season) rounds 12-17 (16.0 injuries per 1,000 hours) resulted in the highest injury incidence. Low cumulative total distances in late preseason ({\textless}108 km) and precompetition (76-88 km) periods were associated with significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater injury risk during the in-season phase. In conclusion, these results suggest players are at the greatest injury risk during the precompetition period, with low preseason cumulative workloads associated with increased in-season injury risk. Therefore, strength and conditioning staff should place particular emphasis on achieving at least moderate training loads during and leading into this phase, where competitive game play is first introduced. {\textcopyright} 2017 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

abstract = {Background Injuries to the hamstring are relatively common in professional cricketers (as they are in many team sports) and have increased in incidence in the “T20 era” (introduction of 20-over matches) of cricket since 2006. Methods This study analyzed incidence of hamstring injury in the various elite male match types over a 20-year period (1995–1996 to 2014–2015 seasons). Risk factors for hamstring strain were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis technique. Results There were 276 match time-loss hamstring injuries recorded over a 20-year period at the Australian state or national player level, of which 170 occurred in one of 40,145 player match sets. The overall rate of match onset rate was 22.5 hamstring injuries per 1000 team days. Fast bowling onset injuries were the highest subcategory at a rate of 10.9 injuries per 1000 team days, although batting onset injuries were particularly common in 50-over (one day) international matches. Significant risk factors in logistic regression analysis, in addition to hamstring injury history, were being a fast bowler relative risk (RR) 2.5 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.3–4.5) and playing a match in Australia RR 2.3 (95{\%}CI: 1.3–3.9). Conclusion Fast bowlers suffer more hamstring injuries than other playing roles in cricket, particularly in First Class (multi-day) cricket. Batsmen are more likely to get injured in 50-over (one day) cricket. Playing in Australia (compared to overseas venues) leads to increased risk of hamstring injury.},

abstract = {The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain "identifying" attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Examine the influence of rehabilitation training loads on return to play (RTP) time and subsequent injury in elite Australian footballers. 

DESIGN
Prospective cohort study. 

METHODS
Internal (sessional rating of perceived exertion: sRPE) and external (distance, sprint distance) workload and lower limb non-contact muscle injury data was collected from 58 players over 5 seasons. Rehabilitation periods were analysed for running workloads and time spent in 3 rehabilitation stages (1: off-legs training, 2: non-football running, 3: group football training) was calculated. Multi-level survival analyses with random effects accounting for player and season were performed. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for each variable were produced for RTP time and time to subsequent injury. 

RESULTS
Of 85 lower limb muscle injuries, 70 were rehabilitated to RTP, with 30 cases of subsequent injury recorded (recurrence rate=11.8{\%}, new site injury rate=31.4{\%}). Completion of high rehabilitation workloads delayed RTP (distance:{\textgreater}49775m [reference: 34613-49775m]: HR 0.12, 95{\%}CI 0.04-0.36, sRPE:{\textgreater}1266AU [reference: 852-1266AU]: HR 0.09, 95{\%}CI 0.03-0.32). Return to running within 4days increased subsequent injury risk (3–4days [reference: 5-6 days]: HR 25.88, 95{\%}CI 2.06-324.4). Attaining moderate-high sprint distance (427-710m) was protective against subsequent injury (154-426m: [reference: 427-710m]: HR 37.41, 95{\%}CI 2.70-518.64). 

CONCLUSION
Training load monitoring can inform player rehabilitation programs. Higher rehabilitation training loads delayed RTP; however, moderate-high sprint running loads can protect against subsequent injury. Shared-decision making regarding RTP should include accumulated training loads and consider the trade-off between expedited RTP and lower subsequent injury risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural genetic variation contributes towards athletic performance in various strength/power and endurance based sports. To date, no studies have explored the genetic predisposition towards skill and athletic performance in Australian Football (AF) players. METHODS: The present pilot study recruited 30 sub-elite AF players who completed tests of endurance, power and technical skill. Specific polymorphisms in nine genes were screened, and assessed for a possible association with athletic and skill traits. RESULTS: Statistical analysis using generalized linear models identified a number of polymorphisms predictive of endurance and technical skill. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), normally responsible for regulation of body fluid volume, was a significant factor in predicting 'all round' athletic performance and skill. Specifically, the deletion allele (DD) of ACE was identified as a predictor for AF power (p{\textless}/=0.008), endurance (p=0.001) and skill assessments (p{\textless}/=0.003). In addition, polymorphisms in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, D2 dopamine receptor, and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes were also shown to contribute to kicking skill outcomes (p{\textless}/=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to implicate the ACE deletion allele for a multi-dimensional sport in such a way. Further, the results from this study have identified several new candidate genes in predicting athletic and technical skill outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene appears to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy and an increased incidence and rate of progression of renal disease. The high incidence of renal disease and end-stage renal failure in the Australian Aboriginal population has prompted investigation of ACE genotypes in these people. METHODS: ACE genotypes were determined in four groups: (i) normal Australian Caucasian blood donors (n = 100), (ii) Caucasian renal transplant recipients (n = 173), (iii) normal Australian Aboriginals from a single tribe (n = 184), and (iv) Australian Aboriginals included in the renal-transplant programme (n = 94). FINDINGS: The D allele frequency in the normal Australian Caucasian (54.5{\%}) and renal transplant groups (57.2{\%}) was similar. However, the D allele frequency in the normal Australian Aboriginal (3{\%}) and Aboriginal renal patient group (14.4{\%}) was significantly lower than both Caucasian groups. INTERPRETATION: The D allele of the ACE gene has little or no influence on the renal disease of Australian Aboriginals.},

abstract = {Re-identification is a major privacy threat to public datasets containing individual records. Many privacy protection algorithms rely on generalization and suppression of "quasi-identifier" attributes such as ZIP code and birthdate. Their objective is usually syntactic sanitization: for example, k-anonymity requires that each "quasi-identifier" tuple appear in at least k records, while l-diversity requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes for each quasi-identifier have high entropy. The utility of sanitized data is also measured syntactically, by the number of generalization steps applied or the number of records with the same quasi-identifier. In this paper, we ask whether generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers offer any benefits over trivial sanitization which simply separates quasi-identifiers from sensitive attributes. Previous work showed that k-anonymous databases can be useful for data mining, but k-anonymization does not guarantee any privacy. By contrast, we measure the tradeoff between privacy (how much can the adversary learn from the sanitized records?) and utility, measured as accuracy of data-mining algorithms executed on the same sanitized records. For our experimental evaluation, we use the same datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as were used in previous research on generalization and suppression. Our results demonstrate that even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility. In most cases, trivial sanitization provides equivalent utility and better privacy than k-anonymity, l-diversity, and similar methods based on generalization and suppression.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association. All rights reserved. Objective: Recent growth in the number of population health researchers accessing detailed datasets, either on their own computers or through virtual data centers, has the potential to increase privacy risks. In response, a checklist for identifying and reducing privacy risks in population health analysis outputs has been proposed for use by researchers themselves. In this study we explore the usability and reliability of such an approach by investigating whether different users identify the same privacy risks on applying the checklist to a sample of publications. Methods: The checklist was applied to a sample of 100 academic population health publications distributed among 5 readers. Cohen's j was used to measure interrater agreement. Results: Of the 566 instances of statistical output types found in the 100 publications, the most frequently occurring were counts, summary statistics, plots, and model outputs. Application of the checklist identified 128 outputs (22.6{\%}) with potential privacy concerns. Most of these were associated with the reporting of small counts. Among these identified outputs, the readers found no substantial actual privacy concerns when context was taken into account. Interrater agreement for identifying potential privacy concerns was generally good. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that a checklist can be a reliable tool to assist researchers with anonymizing analysis outputs in population health research. This further suggests that such an approach may have the potential to be developed into a broadly applicable standard providing consistent confidentiality protection across multiple analyses of the same data.},

abstract = {Objective: Online data centers (ODCs) are becoming increasingly popular for making health-related data available for research. Such centers provide good privacy protection during analysis by trusted researchers, but privacy concerns may still remain if the system outputs are not sufficiently anonymized. In this article, we propose a method for anonymizing analysis outputs from ODCs for publication in academic literature.Methods: We use as a model system the Secure Unified Research Environment, an online computing system that allows researchers to access and analyze linked health-related data for approved studies in Australia. This model system suggests realistic assumptions for an ODC that, together with literature and practice reviews, inform our solution design.Results: We propose a two-step approach to anonymizing analysis outputs from an ODC. A data preparation stage requires data custodians to apply some basic treatments to the dataset before making it available. A subsequent output anonymization stage requires researchers to use a checklist at the point of downloading analysis output. The checklist assists researchers with highlighting potential privacy concerns, then applying appropriate anonymization treatments.Conclusion: The checklist can be used more broadly in health care research, not just in ODCs. Ease of online publication as well as encouragement from journals to submit supplementary material are likely to increase both the volume and detail of analysis results publicly available, which in turn will increase the need for approaches such as the one suggested in this paper.},

abstract = {Objectives: Australian Football League (AFL) players have a high risk of injury. Anecdotally, this injury risk is greater in emerging players (i.e. those in their first year), compared with established players (with 3+ years of experience). This study aimed to conduct the first comparison of injury risk and playing experience in these two player groups across a large number of AFL clubs. Design: Prospective, cohort. Methods: Injuries, game participation and training participation were collected weekly by 8 AFL clubs for 61 emerging and 64 established players. Injury incidence rates (IIR) and Cox proportional hazard models for time to first injury, separately for games and training, were computed. Results: The game IIR was significantly higher for emerging than established players: 45.6 (95{\%} CI: 35.7, 57.6) versus 18.3 (95{\%} CI: 13.1, 24.9) per 1000 game-hours. Emerging players also had a higher training IIR than did the established players: 9.6 (95{\%} CI: 7.6, 11.9) versus 8.9 (95{\%} CI: 7.0, 11.1) per 1000 training-hours. Emerging players were significantly less likely to remain injury free in games than established players (HR = 3.46, 95{\%} CI: 1.27, 9.45). A similar outcome was seen in training sessions, although to a lesser degree (HR = 1.41, 95{\%} CI: 1.19, 1.69). Conclusions: Despite efforts to modify the playing/training program of emerging players, this group remain at greater risk of injury in games and training sessions, compared with established players. Continued efforts should be made toward understanding reasons for this increased risk to better prevent injury during the early years of a professional football career.},

abstract = {We examine a very large-scale data set of more than 30 bil- lion call records made by 25 million cell phone users across all 50 states of the US and attempt to determine to what extent anonymized location data can reveal private user in- formation. Our approach is to infer, from the call records, the “top N” locations for each user and correlate this in- formation with publicly-available side information such as census data. For example, the measured “top 2” locations likely correspond to home and work locations, the “top 3” to home, work, and shopping/school/commute path locations. We consider the cases where those “top N” locations are measured with different levels of granularity, ranging from a cell sector to whole cell, zip code, city, county and state. We then compute the anonymity set, namely the number of users uniquely identified by a given set of “top N” locations at different granularity levels. We find that the “top 1” location does not typically yield small anonymity sets. However, the top 2 and top 3 loca- tions do, certainly at the sector or cell-level granularity. We consider a variety of different factors that might impact the size of the anonymity set, for example the distance between the “top N” locations or the geographic environment (rural vs urban). We also examine to what extent specific side in- formation, in particular the size of the user's social network, decrease the anonymity set and therefore increase risks to privacy. Our study shows that sharing anonymized location data will likely lead to privacy risks and that, at a mini- mum, the data needs to be coarse in either the time domain (meaning the data is collected over short periods of time, in which case inferring the top N locations reliably is difficult) or the space domain (meaning the data granularity is strictly higher than the cell level). In both cases, the utility of the anonymized location data will be decreased, potentially by a significant amount. ∗Part},

abstract = {A number of organizations publish microdata for purposes such as public health and demographic research. Although attributes that clearly identify individuals, such as Name and Social Security Number, are generally removed, these databases can sometimes be joined with other public databases on attributes such as Zipcode, Sex, and Birthdate to re-identify individuals who were supposed to remain anonymous. "Joining" attacks are made easier by the availability of other, complementary, databases over the Internet.K-anonymization is a technique that prevents joining attacks by generalizing and/or suppressing portions of the released microdata so that no individual can be uniquely distinguished from a group of size k. In this paper, we provide a practical framework for implementing one model of k-anonymization, called full-domain generalization. We introduce a set of algorithms for producing minimal full-domain generalizations, and show that these algorithms perform up to an order of magnitude faster than previous algorithms on two real-life databases.Besides full-domain generalization, numerous other models have also been proposed for k-anonymization. The second contribution in this paper is a single taxonomy that categorizes previous models and introduces some promising new alternatives.},

Methods: Data was obtained ( n= 4902) from three Under-18 Australian football competitions between 2010 and 2013. Players were allocated into one of the three groups, based on their highest level of selection in their final year of junior football (Australian Football League Drafted, n= 292; National Championship, n= 293; State-level club, n= 4317). Physiological performance (vertical jumps, agility, speed and running endurance) and anthropometric (body mass and height) data were obtained. Hedge's effect sizes were calculated to assess the influence of selection-level and competition on these physical attributes, with logistic regression models constructed to discriminate Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players. Rule induction analysis was undertaken to determine a set of rules for discriminating selection-level. Results: Effect size comparisons revealed a range of small to moderate differences between State-level club players and both other groups for all attributes, with trivial to small differences between Australian Football League Drafted and National Championship players noted. Logistic regression models showed multistage fitness test, height and 20. m sprint time as the most important attributes in predicting Draft success. Rule induction analysis showed that players displaying multistage fitness test scores of {\textgreater}14.01 and/or 20. m sprint times of {\textless}2.99 s were most likely to be recruited. Conclusions: High levels of performance in aerobic and/or speed tests increase the likelihood of elite junior Australian football players being recruited to the highest level of the sport.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess the association between workload, subjective wellness, musculoskeletal screening measures and non-contact injury risk in elite Australian footballers. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Across 4 seasons in 70 players from one club, cumulative weekly workloads (acute; 1 week, chronic; 2-, 3-, 4-week) and acute:chronic workload ratio's (ACWR: 1-week load/average 4-weekly load) for session-Rating of Perceived Exertion (sRPE) and GPS-derived distance and sprint distance were calculated. Wellness, screening and non-contact injury data were also documented. Univariate and multivariate regression models determined injury incidence rate ratios (IRR) while accounting for interaction/moderating effects. Receiver operating characteristics determined model predictive accuracy (area under curve: AUC). Results Very low cumulative chronic (2-, 3-, 4- week) workloads were associated with the greatest injury risk (univariate IRR = 1.71–2.16, 95{\%} CI = 1.10–4.52) in the subsequent week. In multivariate analysis, the interaction between a low chronic load and a very high distance (adj-IRR = 2.60, 95{\%} CI = 1.07–6.34) or low sRPE ACWR (adj-IRR = 2.52, 95{\%} CI = 1.01–6.29) was associated with increased injury risk. Subjectively reporting “yes” (vs. “no”) for old lower limb pain and heavy non-football activity in the previous 7 days (multivariate adj-IRR = 2.01–2.25, 95{\%} CI = 1.02–4.95) and playing experience ({\textgreater}9 years) (multivariate adj-IRR = 2.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.03–4.06) was also associated with increased injury risk, but screening data were not. Predictive capacity of multivariate models was significantly better than univariate (AUCmultivariate= 0.70, 95{\%} CI 0.64–0.75; AUCunivariaterange = 0.51–0.60). Conclusions Chronic load is an important moderating factor in the workload–injury relationship. Low chronic loads coupled with low or very high ACWR are associated with increased injury risk.},

abstract = {We continue a line of research initiated in Dinur and Nissim (2003); Dwork and Nissim (2004); Blum et al. (2005) on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = i g(x i), where x i denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0, 1]. We extend the study to general functions f , proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f . Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean definition of privacy—now known as differential privacy— and measure of its loss. We also provide a set of tools for designing and combining differentially private algorithms, permitting the construction of complex differentially private analytical tools from simple differentially private primitives. Finally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sta-tistical release mechanisms over non-interactive ones.},

While the previous study provided a broad overview, the current study focused on analyzing the correlation of an article's citation count and its ranking in Google Scholar. For this study, citation counts and rankings of 1,364,757 articles were analyzed. Some results of our first study were confirmed: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that are cited less often. Therefore, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for searching standard literature than for gems or articles by authors advancing a view different from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. In some cases no correlation existed; in others bizarre patterns were recognizable, suggesting that citation counts sometimes have no impact at all on articles' rankings. 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background The ability to generate raw biomedical scientific data is outpacing the comparable availability of compute capabilities for data analysis and knowledge discovery [1]. Within existing clinical environments, where much of these data are generated, systems are primarily architected for high reliability, availability and persistence, and not for rapidly evolving research-driven computationally intensive analytics. Transitioning access of raw data to systems that support these researcher analysis needs remains rare and largely isolated due to concerns with data security and privacy coupled with a lack of established service-oriented data infrastructures. Significance: Processing biomedical data While this project has the potential to identify new capabilities for data analytics within a broad range of data science disciplines, including finance, insurance, and engineering, the primary focus for this project will be medical information. With hospitals currently generating tremendous amounts of patient data including physician notes, laboratory tests, and billing summaries, a significant barrier to utilization of these data is the lack of methodologies to support the chain of custody for the storage, transfer, and derivative analytics when using compute resources external to data origins [2]. Traditionally, what data has been permitted transfer to secondary locations in biomedicine has been in highly aggregated or de-identified forms, which can severely limit its utility [3], and has been criticized as being insufficient as a solely technical solution due to weak points in data provenance through necessary processing and re/delinkage of data [4], [5].},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how location access patterns influence the re-identification of seemingly anonymous data. In the real world, individuals visit different locations that gather similar information. For instance, multiple hospitals collect health information on the same patient. To protect anonymity for research purposes, hospitals share sensitive data, such as DNA sequences, stripped of explicit identifiers. Separately, for administrative functions, identified data, stripped of DNA, is made available. On a hospital by hospital basis, each pair of DNA and identified databases appears unlinkable, however, links can be established when multiple locations' database are studied. This problem, known as trail re-identification, is a generalized phenomenon and occurs because an individual's location access pattern can be matched across the shared databases. Data holders can not exchange data to find and suppress trails that would be re-identified. Thus, it is important to assess the re-identification risk in a system in order to develop techniques to mitigate it. In this research, we evaluate several real world datasets and observe trail re-identification is related to the number of people to places. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we develop a generative model for location access patterns that simulates observed behavior. We evaluate trail re-identification risk in a range of simulated patterns and our findings suggest that the skew of the distribution of people to places is one of the main factors that drives trail re-identification.},

In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95{\%} of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

abstract = {AIMS (1) To investigate whether a daily acute:chronic workload ratio informs injury risk in Australian football players; (2) to identify which combination of workload variable, acute and chronic time window best explains injury likelihood. METHODS Workload and injury data were collected from 53 athletes over 2 seasons in a professional Australian football club. Acute:chronic workload ratios were calculated daily for each athlete, and modelled against non-contact injury likelihood using a quadratic relationship. 6 workload variables, 8 acute time windows (2-9 days) and 7 chronic time windows (14-35 days) were considered (336 combinations). Each parameter combination was compared for injury likelihood fit (using R(2)). RESULTS The ratio of moderate speed running workload (18-24 km/h) in the previous 3 days (acute time window) compared with the previous 21 days (chronic time window) best explained the injury likelihood in matches (R(2)=0.79) and in the immediate 2 or 5 days following matches (R(2)=0.76-0.82). The 3:21 acute:chronic workload ratio discriminated between high-risk and low-risk athletes (relative risk=1.98-2.43). Using the previous 6 days to calculate the acute workload time window yielded similar results. The choice of acute time window significantly influenced model performance and appeared to reflect the competition and training schedule. CONCLUSIONS Daily workload ratios can inform injury risk in Australian football. Clinicians and conditioning coaches should consider the sport-specific schedule of competition and training when choosing acute and chronic time windows. For Australian football, the ratio of moderate speed running in a 3-day or 6-day acute time window and a 21-day chronic time window best explained injury risk.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews provide clinical practice recommendations that are based on evaluation of primary evidence. When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.

abstract = {Objective: Health care organizations must preserve a patient's anonymity when disclosing personal data. Traditionally, patient identity has been protected by stripping identifiers from sensitive data such as DNA. However, simple automated methods can re-identify patient data using public information. In this paper, we present a solution to prevent a threat to patient anonymity that arises when multiple health care organizations disclose data. In this setting, a patient's location visit pattern, or "trail", can re-identify seemingly anonymous DNA to patient identity. This threat exists because health care organizations (1) cannot prevent the disclosure of certain types of patient information and (2) do not know how to systematically avoid trail re-identification. In this paper, we develop and evaluate computational methods that health care organizations can apply to disclose patient-specific DNA records that are impregnable to trail re-identification. Methods and materials: To prevent trail re-identification, we introduce a formal model called k-unlinkability, which enables health care administrators to specify different degrees of patient anonymity. Specifically, k-unlinkability is satisfied when the trail of each DNA record is linkable to no less than k identified records. We present several algorithms that enable health care organizations to coordinate their data disclosure, so that they can determine which DNA records can be shared without violating k-unlinkability. We evaluate the algorithms with the trails of patient populations derived from publicly available hospital discharge databases. Algorithm efficacy is evaluated using metrics based on real world applications, including the number of suppressed records and the number of organizations that disclose records. Results: Our experiments indicate that it is unnecessary to suppress all patient records that initially violate k-unlinkability. Rather, only portions of the trails need to be suppressed. For example, if each hospital discloses 100{\%} of its data on patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, then 48{\%} of the DNA records are 5-unlinkable. A na{\"{i}}ve solution would suppress the 52{\%} of the DNA records that violate 5-unlinkability. However, by applying our protection algorithms, the hospitals can disclose 95{\%} of the DNA records, all of which are 5-unlinkable. Similar findings hold for all populations studied. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that patient anonymity can be formally protected in shared databases. Our findings illustrate that significant quantities of patient-specific data can be disclosed with provable protection from trail re-identification. The configurability of our methods allows health care administrators to quantify the effects of different levels of privacy protection and formulate policy accordingly. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Privacy legislation in most jurisdictions allows the disclosure of health data for secondary purposes without patient consent if it is de-identified. Some recent articles in the medical, legal, and computer science literature have argued that de-identification methods do not provide sufficient protection because they are easy to reverse. Should this be the case, it would have significant and important implications on how health information is disclosed, including: (a) potentially limiting its availability for secondary purposes such as research, and (b) resulting in more identifiable health information being disclosed. Our objectives in this systematic review were to: (a) characterize known re-identification attacks on health data and contrast that to re-identification attacks on other kinds of data, (b) compute the overall proportion of records that have been correctly re-identified in these attacks, and (c) assess whether these demonstrate weaknesses in current de-identification methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Searches were conducted in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. After screening, fourteen eligible articles representing distinct attacks were identified. On average, approximately a quarter of the records were re-identified across all studies (0.26 with 95{\%} CI 0.046-0.478) and 0.34 for attacks on health data (95{\%} CI 0-0.744). There was considerable uncertainty around the proportions as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals, and the mean proportion of records re-identified was sensitive to unpublished studies. Two of fourteen attacks were performed with data that was de-identified using existing standards. Only one of these attacks was on health data, which resulted in a success rate of 0.00013.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The current evidence shows a high re-identification rate but is dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards. This evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of de-identification methods.},

Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Internal (session rating of perceived exertion: sRPE) and external (GPS distance and sprint distance) workload and injury data were collected from 70 players from one AFL club over 4 seasons. Various acute (1–2 weeks) and chronic (3–8 weeks) timeframes were used to calculate ACWRs: these and chronic load categories were then analysed to determine the injury risk in the subsequent month. Poisson regression with robust errors within a generalised estimating equation were utilised to determine incidence rate ratios (IRR). Results Altering acute and/or chronic timeframes did not improve the ability to detect high injury risk conditions above the commonly used 1:4 week ACWR. Twenty-seven ACWR/chronic load combinations were found to be “high risk conditions” (IRR {\textgreater} 1, p {\textless} 0.05) for injury within 7 days. Most (93{\%}) of these conditions occurred when chronic load was low or very low and ACWR was either low ({\textless}0.6) or high ({\textgreater}1.5). Once a high injury risk condition was entered, the elevated risk persisted for up to 28 days. Conclusions Injury risk was greatest when chronic load was low and ACWR was either low or high. This heightened risk remained for up to 4 weeks. There was no improvement in the ability to identify high injury risk situations by altering acute or chronic time periods from 1:4 weeks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Police officers are required to perform dynamic movements in unpredictable environments, the results of which can lead to injury. Early identification of poor movement patterns of a police population, and potential sub groups within this population, may provide opportunities to treat and minimise injury risks. The aim of this study was to profile the functional movement capabilities of an Australian state police force and potential sub groups through a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective data from an Australian State Police Force were provided for analysis (male symbol n = 1155, mean (+/-SD) age = 31.34 +/- 8.41 years: female symbol n = 357, mean age = 27.99 +/- 8.02 years). Data consisted of Functional Movement Screen (FMS) assessment results of male and female trainees and qualified police officers with all assessments conducted by a qualified Police Physical Training Instructor. RESULTS: Significantly higher (U = 253863, p {\textless} .001) FMS total scores were found for recruits (mean 15.23 +/- SD 2.01 points) when compared to attested officers (14.57 +/- 2.96 points) and differences in FMS total scores also approached significance for females (15.24 +/- 2.35 points) when compared to males (14.84 +/- 2.55 points, U = 186926, p = .007), with age found to be a key, significant factor in explaining these observed differences (F (1,1507) = 23.519, p {\textless} .001). The FMS components demonstrating poorest movement performance across all groups were the hurdle step and rotary stability. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, police personnel (both attested officers and recruits of both genders) of greater age have a lower functional movement capability when compared to younger personnel, with greater percentages scoring 14 or below on the FMS. Specific conditioning programs to improve strength, range of motion and stability during identified key movement types in those demonstrating poorer movement performance may serve to reduce injuries in police personnel.},

abstract = {This paper aims at answering the following two questions in privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing: What formal privacy guarantee (if any) does {\$}k{\$}-anonymization provide? How to benefit from the adversary's uncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a connection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create uncertainty. The main result of the paper is that {\$}k{\$}-anonymization, when done "safely", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies {\$}(\backslashepsilon,\backslashdelta){\$}-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This result illustrates that "hiding in a crowd of {\$}k{\$}" indeed offers some privacy guarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output perturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random sampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to change of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a random-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can greatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset resulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the negative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's uncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in practice.},

It is not clear whether currently available soft headgear can mitigate the effects of a concussive impact and it is concerning that a notable proportion of the playing population have a misbelief in their protective effect. In order to enhance development of modern and effective headgear, this study investigated suitability of smart polymer materials via both standardised and novel biomechanical test methodologies. Superior performances of the smart polymers to that of the existing products were generally observed and resulted in the reductions of at least 40{\%} in the probability of concussion. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) severity rating suggested two-fold improvement over the existing headgear if the smart polymers were used as a replacement for the cushioning material in the current products.},

abstract = {The problem of information disclosure has attracted much interest from the research community in recent years. When disclosing information, the challenge is to provide as much information as possible (optimality) while guaranteeing a desired safety property for privacy (such as l-diversity). A typical disclosure algorithm uses a sequence of disclosure schemas to output generalizations in the nonincreasing order of data utility; the algorithm releases the first generalization that satisfies the safety property. In this paper, we assert that the desired safety property cannot always be guaranteed if an adversary has the knowledge of the underlying disclosure algorithm. We propose a model for the additional information disclosed by an algorithm based on the definition of deterministic disclosure function (DDF), and provide definitions of p-safe and p-optimal DDFs. We give an analysis for the complexity to compute a p-optimal DDF. We show that deciding whether a DDF is p-optimal is an NP-hard problem, and only under specific conditions, we can solve the problem in polynomial time with respect to the size of the set of all possible database instances and the length of the disclosure generalization sequence. We then consider the problem of microdata disclosure and the safety condition of l-diversity. We relax the notion of p-optimality to weak p-optimality, and develop a weak p-optimal algorithm which is polynomial in the size of the original table and the length of the generalization sequence.},

@article{Sweeny2002,
abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

@article{Dwork2006,
abstract = {. In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy. 1},
