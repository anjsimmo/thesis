This thesis bridges the gap between raw position sensor measurements of individuals and high level strategic insights about group formations and behaviours. Specifically, it investigates the viability of GPS player tracking data in Australian Rules Football for strategy analysis and shows how characteristics of the sport domain affect the design of the data processing pipeline.

The core contribution of this thesis is a systematic investigation of the pipeline of transformation operations necessary to lift raw GPS player tracking data to a form that can be mined for insights relevant to a sport coach. For each component of the pipeline, the design decisions involved are identified and linked to the types of insights that can be extracted as well as the privacy implications for players. The methodology recognises the role of both manual and automated analysis processes in sport performance analysis as part of the processing pipeline. Data provenance standards are adapted to the context of sport to document the interplay of manual and automated analyses in a manner that is repeatable and auditable.

A review of common methods for data de-identification prevalent in the sport literature shows that: they are not suitable for position data; do not protect individual player privacy against data linkage attacks; and may be in violation of human ethics guidelines. This thesis addresses these shortfalls through a proposal to de-identify position tracking data by transforming them to a point~cloud representation (an unordered set of points) thus preventing re-identification of individuals while preserving the ability to perform spatio-temporal team-level analysis. To address the gap between theoretical techniques for privacy preservation and those used in practice, this thesis introduces a software tool and associated interaction model for data sharing that reduces the potential for human errors.

Given the unique nature of Australian Rules Football, there are special normalisation requirements to make effective use of positional data, as each field has a different shape and orientation. This thesis develops a novel technique for marking up coordinate systems at each venue to account for this.

Finally, a computational pipeline for Australian Rules Football is constructed using the techniques proposed in this thesis to demonstrate that they can be combined to provide meaningful team-level insights into formation changes during the game without compromising individual privacy.
