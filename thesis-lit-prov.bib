abstract = {Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources.In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance characteristics and apply it to current research efforts in e-science, focusing primarily on scientific workflow approaches. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.},

abstract = {Scientists are now faced with an incredible volume of data to analyze. To successfully analyze and validate various hypothesis, it is necessary to pose several queries, correlate disparate data, and create insightful visualizations of both the simulated processes and observed phenomena. Often, insight comes from comparing the results of multiple visualizations. Unfortunately, today this process is far from interactive and contains many error-prone and time-consuming tasks. As a result, the generation and maintenance of visualizations is a major bottleneck in the scientific process, hindering both the ability to mine scientific data and the actual use of the data. The VisTrails system represents our initial attempt to improve the scientific discovery process and reduce the time to insight. In VisTrails, we address the problem of visualization from a data management perspective: VisTrails manages the data and metadata of a visualization product. In this demonstration, we show the power and flexibility of our system by presenting actual scenarios in which scientific visualization is used and showing how our system improves usability, enables reproducibility, and greatly reduces the time required to create scientific visualizations.},

abstract = {Provenance has been touted as a basis to establish trust in data. Intuitively, belief in a hypothesis should depend on how much one trusts the relevant data. However, current proposals to assess trust based solely on provenance are insufficient for rigourous decision making. We describe a model of provenance and belief that is necessary and sufficient to incorporate trust in the data in a way that supports normative inference. The model is based on the observation that provenance can be viewed as a causal structure which can be used to compute belief from assessments of the accuracy of sources and transformations that produced relevant data. In our model, data sources are like sensors with associated conditional probability tables. Provenance identifies dependencies among sensors. Together, this information allows construction of causal networks that can be used to compute the belief in a state of the world based on observation of data. This model formalizes the role of source accuracy, and provides a method for formally assessing belief that uses only information in the provenance store, not the contents of the data.},

@article{Belhajjame2015,
abstract = {Abstract Scientific workflows are a popular mechanism for specifying and automating data-driven in silico experiments. A significant aspect of their value lies in their potential to be reused. Once shared, workflows become useful building blocks that can be combined or modified for developing new experiments. However, previous studies have shown that storing workflow specifications alone is not sufficient to ensure that they can be successfully reused, without being able to understand what the workflows aim to achieve or to re-enact them. To gain an understanding of the workflow, and how it may be used and repurposed for their needs, scientists require access to additional resources such as annotations describing the workflow, datasets used and produced by the workflow, and provenance traces recording workflow executions. In this article, we present a novel approach to the preservation of scientific workflows through the application of research objects - aggregations of data and metadata that enrich the workflow specifications. Our approach is realised as a suite of ontologies that support the creation of workflow-centric research objects. Their design was guided by requirements elicited from previous empirical analyses of workflow decay and repair. The ontologies developed make use of and extend existing well known ontologies, namely the Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) vocabulary, the Annotation Ontology (AO) and the W3C PROV ontology (PROVO). We illustrate the application of the ontologies for building Workflow Research Objects with a case-study that investigates Huntington's disease, performed in collaboration with a team from the Leiden University Medial Centre (HG-LUMC). Finally we present a number of tools developed for creating and managing workflow-centric research objects.},

abstract = {The data preprocessing is an essential step in knowledge discovery projects. The experts affirm that preprocessing tasks take between 50{\%} to 70{\%} of the total time of the knowledge discovery process. In this sense, several authors consider the data cleaning as one of the most cumbersome and critical tasks. Failure to provide high data quality in the preprocessing stage will significantly reduce the accuracy of any data analytic project. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the data quality issues in classification tasks DQF4CT. Our approach is composed of: (i) a conceptual framework to provide the user guidance on how to deal with data problems in classification tasks; and (ii) an ontology that represents the knowledge in data cleaning and suggests the proper data cleaning approaches. We presented two case studies through real datasets: physical activity monitoring (PAM) and occupancy detection of an office room (OD). With the aim of evaluating our proposal, the cleaned datasets by DQF4CT were used to train the same algorithms used in classification tasks by the authors of PAM and OD. Additionally, we evaluated DQF4CT through datasets of the Repository of Machine Learning Databases of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). In addition, 84{\%} of the results achieved by the models of the datasets cleaned by DQF4CT are better than the models of the datasets authors.},

@article{Brauer2012,
abstract = {The World Wide Web evolves into a Web of Data, a huge, globally distributed dataspace that contains a rich body of machine-processable information from a virtually unbound set of providers covering a wide range of topics. However, due to the openness of the Web little is known about who created the data and how. The fact that a large amount of the data on the Web is derived by replication, query processing, modification, or merging raises concerns of information quality. Poor quality data may propagate quickly and contaminate the Web of Data. Provenance information about who created and published the data and how, provides the means for quality assessment. This paper takes a first step towards creating a quality-aware Web of Data: we present approaches to integrate provenance information into the Web of Data and we illustrate how this information can be consumed. In particular, we introduce a vocabulary to describe provenance of Web data as metadata and we discuss possibilities to make such provenance metadata accessible as part of the Web of Data. Furthermore, we describe how this metadata can be queried and consumed to identify outdated information.},

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of reproducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments.},

@article{Acar2010,
abstract = {Provenance has been studied extensively in both database and workflow management systems, so far with little convergence of definitions or models. Provenance in databases has generally been defined for relational or complex object data, by propagating fine-grained annotations or algebraic expressions from the input to the output. This kind of provenance has been found useful in other areas of computer science: annotation databases, probabilistic databases, schema and data integration, etc. In contrast, workflow provenance aims to capture a complete description of evaluation - or enactment - of a workflow, and this is crucial to verification in scientific computation. Workflows and their provenance are often presented using graphical notation, making them easy to visualize but complicating the formal semantics that relates their run-time behavior with their provenance records. We bridge this gap by extending a previously-developed dataflow language which supports both database-style querying and workflow-style batch processing steps to produce a workflow-style provenance graph that can be explicitly queried. We define and describe the model through examples, present queries that extract other forms of provenance, and give an executable definition of the graph semantics of dataflow expressions.},

Systematic analysis of this scientific information unleashes a growing need for automated data-driven applications that also can keep track of the provenance of the data and processes with little user interaction and overhead. Such data analysis can be facilitated by the recent advancements in scientific workflow systems. A major profit when using scientific workflow systems is the ability to make provenance collection a part of the workflow. Specifically, provenance should include not only the standard data lineage information but also information about the context in which the workflow was used, execution that processed the data, and the evolution of the workflow design. In this paper we describe a complete framework for data and process provenance in the Kepler Scientific Workflow System. We outline the requirements and issues related to data and workflow provenance in a multi-disciplinary workflow system and introduce how generic provenance capture can be facilitated in Keplers actor-oriented workflow environment. We also describe the usage of the stored provenance information for efficient rerun of scientific workflows.},

abstract = {Major natural or man-made disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the 9/11 terror attacks pose significant challenges for emergency responders. First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in The most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system.},

abstract = {Data lineage describes the relationship between individual input and output data items of a workflow, and has served as an integral ingredient for both traditional (e.g., debugging, auditing, data integration, and security) and emergent (e.g., interactive visualizations, iterative analytics, explanations, and cleaning) applications. The core, long-standing problem that lineage systems need to address---and the main focus of this paper---is to capture the relationships between input and output data items across a workflow with the goal to streamline queries over lineage. Unfortunately, current lineage systems either incur high lineage capture overheads, or lineage query processing costs, or both. As a result, applications, that in principle can express their logic declaratively in lineage terms, resort to hand-tuned implementations. To this end, we introduce Smoke, an in-memory database engine that neither lineage capture overhead nor lineage query processing needs to be compromised. To do so, Smoke introduces tight integration of the lineage capture logic into physical database operators; efficient, write-optimized lineage representations for storage; and optimizations when future lineage queries are known up-front. Our experiments on microbenchmarks and realistic workloads show that Smoke reduces the lineage capture overhead and streamlines lineage queries by multiple orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Our experiments on real-world applications highlight that Smoke can meet the latency requirements of interactive visualizations (e.g., {\textless}150ms) and outperform hand-written implementations of data profiling primitives.},

abstract = {In Geographic Information Systems (GIS), geoprocessing workflows allow analysts to organize their methods on spatial data in complex chains. We propose a method for expressing workflows as linked data, and for semi-automatically enriching them with semantics on the level of their operations and datasets. Linked workflows can be easily published on the Web and queried for types of inputs, results, or tools. Thus, GIS analysts can reuse their workflows in a modular way, selecting, adapting, and recom- mending resources based on compatible semantic types. Our typing approach starts from minimal annotations of workflow operations with classes of GIS tools, and then propagates data types and implicit semantic structures through the workflow using an OWL typing scheme and SPARQL rules by backtracking over GIS operations. The method is implemented in Python and is evaluated on two real-world geoprocessing workflows, generated with Esri's ArcGIS. To illustrate the potential applications of our typing method, we formulate and execute competency questions over these workflows},

abstract = {Geospatial data provenance is a fundamental issue in distributing spatial information on the Web. In the geoinformatics domain, provenance is often referred to as lineage. While the ISO 19115 lineage model is used widely in spatial data infrastructures, W3C has recommended the W3C provenance (PROV) data model for capturing and sharing provenance information on the Web. The use of these two separate efforts needs to be harmonized so that geospatial information does not remain an isolated area on the Web. Motivated by several domain use cases, we synthesize a list of provenance questions and analyze gaps between the two models in addressing these questions. Our strategy is to enrich W3C PROV with domain semantics from the ISO 19115 lineage model by suggesting ways to bridge them. A semantic mapping between the ISO lineage model and the W3C PROV model is formalized, and key issues involved are discussed. Use cases illustrate the applicability of the approach.},

abstract = {Information produced by Internet applications is inherently a result of processes that are executed locally. Think of a web server that makes use of a CGI script, or a content management system where a post was first edited using a word processor. Given the impact of these processes to the content published online, a consumer of that information may want to understand what those impacts were. For example, understanding from where text was copied and pasted to make a post, or if the CGI script was updated with the latest security patches, may all influence the confidence on the published content. Capturing and exposing this information provenance is thus important in order to ascertaining trust to online content. Furthermore, providers of internet applications may wish to have access to the same information for debugging or audit purposes. For processes following a rigid structure (such as databases or workflows), disclosed provenance systems have been developed that efficiently and accurately capture the provenance of the produced data. However, accurately capturing provenance from unstructured processes, e.g. user-interactive computing used to produce web content, remains a problem to be tackled. In this paper, we address the problem of capturing and exposing provenance from unstructured processes. Our approach, called PROV 2R (PROVenance Record and Replay) is composed of two parts: 1) the decoupling of provenance analysis from its capture; and 2) the capture of high fidelity provenance from unmodified programs. We use techniques originating in the security and reverse engineering communities, namely, record and replay and taint tracking. Taint tracking fundamentally addresses the data provenance problem, but is impractical to apply at runtime due to extremely high overhead. With a number of case studies we demonstrate that PROV 2R enables the use of taint analysis for high fidelity provenance capture, while keeping the runtime overhead at manageable levels. In addition, we show how captured information can be represented using the W3C PROV provenance model for exposure on the Web.},

abstract = {Enabling provenance interoperability by analyzing heterogeneous provenance information from different scientific workflow management systems is a novel research topic. With the advent of the ProvONE model, it is now possible to model both the prospective as well as the retrospective provenance in a single provenance model. Scientific workflows are composed using a declarative definition language, such as BPEL, SCUFL/t2flow, or MoML. Associated with the execution of a workflow is its corresponding provenance that is modeled and stored in the data model specified by the workflow system. However, sharing of provenance generated by heterogeneous workflows is a challenging task and prevents the aggregate analysis and comparison of workflows and their associated provenance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a ProvONE-based Provenance Interoperability Framework that completely automates the modeling of provenance from heterogeneous WfMSs by: (a) automatically translating the scientific workflows to their equivalent representation in a ProvONE prospective graph using the Prov2ONE algorithm, (b) enriching the ProvONE prospective graph with the retrospective provenance exported by the WfMSs, and (c) native support for storing the ProvONE provenance graphs in a Resource Description Framework triplestore that supports the SPARQL query language for querying and retrieving ProvONE graphs. The Prov2ONE algorithm is based on a set of vocabulary translation rules between workflow specifications and the ProvONE model. The correctness and completeness proof of the algorithm is shown and its complexity is analyzed. Moreover, to demonstrate the practical applicability of the complete framework, ProvONE graphs for workflows defined in BPEL, SCUFL, and MoML are generated. Finally, the provenance challenge queries are extended with six additional queries for retrieving the provenance modeled in ProvONE.},

abstract = {We present PANDA, an open-source tool that has been purpose-built to support whole system reverse engineering. It is built upon the QEMU whole system emulator, and so analyses have access to all code executing in the guest and all data. PANDA adds the ability to record and replay executions, enabling iterative, deep, whole system analyses. Further, the replay log files are compact and shareable, allowing for repeatable experiments. A nine billion instruction boot of FreeBSD, e.g., is represented by only a few hundred MB. PANDA leverages QEMU's support of thirteen different CPU architectures to make analyses of those diverse instruction sets possible within the LLVM IR. In this way, PANDA can have a single dynamic taint analysis, for example, that precisely supports many CPUs. PANDA analyses are written in a simple plugin architecture which includes a mechanism to share functionality between plug- ins, increasing analysis code re-use and simplifying complex analysis development. We demonstrate PANDA's effectiveness via a number of use cases, including enabling an old but legitimately purchased game to run despite a lost CD key, in-depth diagnosis of an Internet Explorer crash, and uncovering the censorship activities and mechanisms of an IM client.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web evolves into a Web of Data, a huge, globally distributed dataspace that contains a rich body of machine-processable information from a virtually unbound set of providers covering a wide range of topics. However, due to the openness of the Web little is known about who created the data and how. The fact that a large amount of the data on the Web is derived by replication, query processing, modification, or merging raises concerns of information quality. Poor quality data may propagate quickly and contaminate the Web of Data. Provenance information about who created and published the data and how, provides the means for quality assessment. This paper takes a first step towards creating a quality-aware Web of Data: we present approaches to integrate provenance information into the Web of Data and we illustrate how this information can be consumed. In particular, we introduce a vocabulary to describe provenance of Web data as metadata and we discuss possibilities to make such provenance metadata accessible as part of the Web of Data. Furthermore, we describe how this metadata can be queried and consumed to identify outdated information.},

Programmers write programs that log values and package them up in sets of bindings, a data structure associating variables and values. An expansion algorithm generates instantiated provenance from templates and sets of bindings in any of the serialisation formats supported by prov. A quantitative evaluation shows that sets of bindings have a size that is typically 40 percent of that of expanded provenance templates and that the expansion algorithm is suitably tractable, operating in fractions of milliseconds for the type of templates surveyed in the article. Furthermore, the approach shows four significant software engineering benefits: separation of responsibilities, provenance maintenance, potential runtime checks and static analysis, and provenance consumption. The article gathers quantitative data and qualitative benefits descriptions from four different applications making use of prov-template.

The preservation of the materials and methods of such computational experiments with clear annotations is essential for understanding an experiment, and this is increasingly recognized in the bioinformatics community. Our assumption is that offering means of digital, structured aggregation and annotation of the objects of an experiment will provide necessary meta-data for a scientist to understand and recreate the results of an experiment. To support this we explored a model for the semantic description of a workflow-centric Research Object (RO), where an RO is defined as a resource that aggregates other resources, e.g., datasets, software, spreadsheets, text, etc. We applied this model to a case study where we analysed human metabolite variation by workflows.},

Research on provenance, which focuses on different ways to describe and record the history of changes and advances made throughout an analysis process, is an integral part of visual analytics. This paper focuses on providing the provenance of insight and rationale through visualizations while emphasizing, first, that this entails a profound understanding of human cognition and reasoning and that, second, the special nature of spatiotemporal data needs to be acknowledged in this process. A recently proposed human reasoning framework for spatiotemporal analysis, and four guidelines for the creation of visualizations that provide the provenance of insight and rationale published in relation to that framework, work as a starting point for this paper. While these guidelines are quite abstract, this paper set out to create a set of more concrete guidelines. On the basis of a review of available provenance solutions, this paper identifies a set of key features that are of relevance when providing the provenance of insight and rationale and, on the basis of these features, produces a new set of complementary guidelines that are more practically oriented than the original ones. Together, these two sets of guidelines provide both a theoretical and practical approach to the problem of providing the provenance of insight and rationale. Providing these kinds of guidelines represents a new approach in provenance research.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of database views and curated databases, the issue of data provenance - where a piece of data came from and the process by which it arrived in the database - is becoming increasingly important, especially in scientific databases where understanding provenance is crucial to the accuracy and currency of data. In this paper we describe an approach to computing provenance when the data of interest has been created by a database query. We adopt a syntactic approach and present results for a general data model that applies to relational databases as well as to hierarchical data such as XML. A novel aspect of our work is a distinction between “why” provenance (refers to the source data that had some influence on the existence of the data) and “where” provenance (refers to the location(s) in the source databases from which the data was extracted).},

Such a pipeline requires much glue code to get data across environments. Maintaining and evolving these pipelines are difficult. Pipeline frameworks that try to solve such problems are usually built on top of a single environment. They might require rewriting the original job to take into account a new API or paradigm. The Pipeline61 framework supports the building of data pipelines involving heterogeneous execution environments.

A real-world case study shows its effectiveness. This article is part of a special issue on Software Engineering for Big Data Systems.},

abstract = {GIS (Geographic Information Systems) play an important role to acquire and communicate geospatial knowledge based on spatial data and the use of spatial analysis, modeling, and visualization. The assurance of the validity and quality of spatial data handling and analysis remains a great challenge, in part, because of sophisticated procedures are often required for collaborative geospatial problem-solving and decision making. These procedures, when specified as knowledge derivation workflows, require carefully configured parameters and spatiotemporal specifications guided by specific contexts and purposes. The information of spatial data lineage and related analysis workflow is defined as spatial provenance in this research. Such information is often not well recorded or managed during spatial data handling and related analysis. This paper presents a provenance-aware GIS architecture that incorporates spatial provenance to address this shortcoming and facilitate the assurance of validity and quality of spatial data handling and analysis. Spatial provenance in this architecture is generated and managed to allow queries on data lineage and workflow information to support geospatial problemsolving. Basic elements of spatial provenance are captured using a spatial provenance model. The illustration of the provenanceaware GIS architecture and its proof-of-concept implementation reveals the similarity and difference in the use of spatial provenance in GIS applications. Overall, the architecture and implementation described in the paper demonstrates the necessity and feasibility of introducing provenance into GIS. {\textcopyright} 2008 ACM.},

@article{Cox2015,
abstract = {The PROV data model is becoming accepted as a flexible and robust tool for formalizing information relating to the production of documents and datasets. Provenance stores based on the PROV-O implementation are appearing in support of scientific data workflows. However, the scope of PROV does not have to be limited to digital or information assets. For example, specimens typically undergo complex preparation sequences prior to actual observations and measurements, and it is important to record this to ensure reproducibility and to enable assessment of the reliability of data produced. PROV provides a flexible solution, allowing a comprehensive trace of predecessor entities and transformations at any level of detail. In this paper we demonstrate the use of PROV for describing specimens managed for scientific observations. Two examples are considered: a geological sample which undergoes a typical preparation process for measurements of the concentration of a particular chemical substance, and the collection, taxonomic classification and eventual publication of an insect specimen. We briefly compare PROV with related work. 1. INTRODUCTION The concept of provenance was developed in the art, museums and archives community, referring to a record of the history of an artefact. Tracing the history of ownership and custodianship is an important means of determining the authenticity of rare or unique items. More recently, the same term has been applied to the lineage of information objects -particularly datasets, imagery, etc. These may have a complex history with multiple data-processing steps, the details of which are important in evaluating the quality or fitness for a particular purpose, and also for establishing reproducibility which is a core tenet of empirical science. In this setting, a 'provenance trace' can be seen as the record of an instantiated 'workflow'. The W3C PROV model [6,9] harmonizes a number of earlier treatments (in particular PML and OPM) and is becoming accepted as the basis for formalizing information relating to the production of documents and datasets. Provenance stores based on the PROV-O implementation, such as PROMS [1], are appearing in support of scientific data workflows. In the context of technical and scientific collections, where specimens (biological, water, soil and rock) are managed to support subsequent observations, chain of custody concerns do arise, particularly in relation to forensic applications, and also where there are financial implications from results of observations on samples, such as assays on mineral exploration specimens. But the key feature of technical and scientific specimens is the preparation process, generating a sequence of samples -some of which only exist temporarily -which are related through various processing activities, in support of the observational requirements. There is enormous variety in the process-chains related to these, both between and within disciplines. In fact, the design of new sequences is a key activity in empirical science. The PROV ontology -which abstracts all possible processing chains into a single high level model whereby the production and transformation of Entities is through time-bounded Activities, under the influence or control of Agents -appears to provide a framework that can satisfy all of the relevant concerns, either directly or through minor specializations within a basic framework.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing techniques have led to exponential growth in biological data, demanding the development of large-scale bioinformatics experiments. Because these experiments are computation- and data-intensive, they require high-performance computing (HPC) techniques and can benefit from specialized technologies such as Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS) and databases. In this work, we present BioWorkbench, a framework for managing and analyzing bioinformatics experiments. This framework automatically collects provenance data, including both performance data from workflow execution and data from the scientific domain of the workflow application. Provenance data can be analyzed through a web application that abstracts a set of queries to the provenance database, simplifying access to provenance information. We evaluate BioWorkbench using three case studies: SwiftPhylo, a phylogenetic tree assembly workflow; SwiftGECKO, a comparative genomics workflow; and RASflow, a RASopathy analysis workflow. We analyze each workflow from both computational and scientific domain perspectives, by using queries to a provenance and annotation database. Some of these queries are available as a pre-built feature of the BioWorkbench web application. Through the provenance data, we show that the framework is scalable and achieves high-performance, reducing up to 98{\%} of the case studies execution time. We also show how the application of machine learning techniques can enrich the analysis process.},

abstract = {In this position paper we present a set of best practices for workflow design to prevent workflow decay and increase reuse and re-purposing of scientific workflows. MyExperiment provides access to a large number of scientific workflows. However, scientists find it difficult to reuse or re-purpose these workflows for mainly two reasons: workflows suffer from decay over time and lack sufficient metadata to understand their purpose. We argue that good workflow design is a prerequisite for repairing a workflow, or redesigning an equivalent workflow pattern with new components. We present a set of best practices for workflow design and the semantic tooling that is being developed in the Workflow4Ever (Wf4Ever) project to support these best practices.},
