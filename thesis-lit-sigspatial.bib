abstract = {Old maps are increasingly used as a source for historical research. This is a consequence of the increased availability of old maps in digital form, of the emergence of user-friendly Geographical Information Systems, and of a heightened awareness of the unique information stored in old maps. As with every source for historical studies, when old maps are georeferenced and information is extracted for historical research, the accuracy and reliability of the geometric and semantic information must be assessed. In this paper, a method based on a series of geometric transformations is presented, which transforms control points of a modern reference map to the coordinate system of an old map. Based on these transformed points, the planimetric and geodetic accuracy of the old map can be computationally analyzed and various visualizations of space deformation can be generated. The results are graphical representations of map distortion, such as distortion grids or displacement vectors, as well as statistical and geodetic measures describing the map geometry (e.g., map scale, rotation angle, and map projection). The visualizations help to assess the geometric accuracy of historical geographical information before using the data for geo-historical studies. The visualizations can also provide valuable information to the map historian about the history of a particular map and its creation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recollection rejection is a memory editing mechanism in which related lures are rejected because of the recollection of the lure's instantiating target (e.g., "I know it wasn't pretty because it was beautiful"). According to one view, recollection rejection requires an assumption on the part of the participant that both a word and its related lure could not have been studied. We examined this view by manipulating the instructions that were given to participants (Experiment 1) and the nature of the study list (Experiment 2). Estimates of recollection rejection derived from the phantom receive operating characteristic model found evidence for the role of metacognitive assumptions, but only when metacognitive knowledge was manipulated by varying the nature of the study list.},

abstract = {Recent growth of geospatial information online has made it possible to access various maps and orthoimagery. Conflating these maps and imagery can create images that combine the visual appeal of imagery with the attribution information from maps. The existing systems require human intervention to conflate maps with imagery. We present a novel approach that utilizes vector datasets as "glue" to automatically conflate street maps with imagery. First, our approach extracts road intersections from imagery and maps as control points. Then, it aligns the two point sets by computing the matched point pattern. Finally, it aligns maps with imagery based on the matched pattern. The experiments show that our approach can conflate various maps with imagery, such that in our experiments on TIGER-maps covering part of St. Louis county, MO, 85.2{\%} of the conflated map roads are within 10.8 m from the actual roads compared to 51.7{\%} for the original and georeferenced TIGER-map roads.},

abstract = {The World of Mapping ISSN: 0008-7041 (Print) 1743-2774 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/ycaj20 The selection of map projections is difficult and confusing for many. This article introduces Projection Wizard, an online map projection selection tool available at projectionwizard.org that helps mapmakers select projections. The user selects the desired distortion property, and the area to be mapped on an interactive web map. Projection Wizard then proposes a projection, along with projection parameters (such as standard parallels). The tool also creates a preview map with the proposed projection, and provides the corresponding projection code in PROJ.4 format, if applicable. The automated selection process is based on John P. Snyder's selection guideline with a few adjustments. This article discusses the automated selection process, and the map projections suggested. Projection Wizard solves the problem of map projection selection for many applications and helps cartographers and GIS users choose appropriate map projections. A common goal when selecting a map projection is to find a projection and projection parameters that minimize dis-tortion of the mapped area. To meet this objective, a map projection has to satisfy the requirements set by the particular purpose of a map (Bugayevskiy and Snyder, 1995). The criteria for selecting a projection include the location of the mapped area, the directional extent of the mapped area, and the required distortion property. In some cases, especially when designing small-scale maps, cartographers are left with a number of projections that meet these requirements. There is a plethora of map projections available for carto-graphers to choose from, and applying the selection criteria is a difficult task (De Genst and Canters, 1996; Finn et al., 2004; Slocum et al., 2009; Snyder, 1993). GIS and mapping software enable less experienced mapmakers to create maps, but the selection criteria for map projections are a mystery to many (De Genst and Canters, 1996; Finn et al., 2004, in press). Often, mapmakers use default projections, e.g., the Plate Carr{\'{e}}e, which is commonly used for distributing geospatial data, or the Mercator pro-jection when creating web maps (Battersby et al., 2014). This paper introduces Projection Wizard, an online map projection selection tool that is available for free at projec-tionwizard.org. The goal of Projection Wizard is to help mapmakers select appropriate map projections and thus create better maps.},

The objective of our research has been to develop a method to visualize, and work with, the spatial interconnectedness of information over time and geography within a single, highly interactive 3D view. A novel visualization technique for displaying and tracking events, objects and activities within a combined temporal and geospatial display has been developed. This technique has been implemented as a demonstratable prototype called GeoTime in order to determine potential utility. Initial evaluations have been with military users. However, we believe the concept is applicable to a variety of government and business analysis tasks},

Despite the recent advances allowing space–time cube visualization of clusters of trajectories, it is problematic to represent trajectory attributes. We propose a new time transformation—sequential ordering—that transforms the space–time cube into a new display, trajectory wall, which allows effective and efficient visualization of trajectory attributes for trajectories following similar routes. To enable temporal analysis regarding temporal cycles, we use a time lens technique for interactive visualization. We demonstrate the work of the method on a real data set with trajectories of cars in a big city.},

	abstract = {Drawing heavily from Bloom's Taxonomy, this new book helps teachers understand and implement a standards-based curriculum.  An extraordinary group of cognitive psychologists, curriculum specialists, teacher-educators, and researchers have developed a two-dimensional framework, focusing on knowledge and cognitive processes, that defines what students are expected to learn in school. A series of vignettes-written by and for teachers-illustrates how to use this unique framework. A revision only in the sense that it builds on the original framework, it is a completely new manuscript in both text and organization. Its two-dimensional framework interrelates knowledge with the cognitive processes students use to gain and work with knowledge. Together, these define the goals, curriculum standards, and objectives students are expected to learn. The framework facilitates the exploration of curriculums from four perspectives-what is intended to be taught, how it is to be taught, how learning is to be assessed, and how well the intended aims, instruction and assessments are aligned for effective education. This "revisited" framework allows you to connect learning from all these perspectives. This "Professional Edition" includes an additional section ("The Taxonomy in Perspective,") which is not available in the "Revisited for Teachers" edition of the book.},

@book{snyder_flattening_1993,
abstract = {As long as there have been maps, cartographers have grappled with the impossibility of portraying the earth in two dimensions. To solve this problem mapmakers have created hundreds of map projections, mathematical methods for drawing the round earth on a flat surface. Yet of the hundreds of existing projections, and the infinite number that are theoretically possible, none is perfectly accurate.Flattening the Earth is the first detailed history of map projections since 1863. John P. Snyder discusses and illustrates the hundreds of known projections created from 500 B.C. to the present, emphasizing developments since the Renaissance and closing with a look at the variety of projections made possible by computers.The book contains 170 illustrations, including outline maps from original sources and modern computerized reconstructions. Though the text is not mathematically based, a few equations are included to permit the more technical reader to plot some projections. Tables summarize the features of nearly two hundred different projections and list those used in nineteenth-and twentieth-century atlases."This book is unique and significant: a thorough, well-organized, and insightful history of map projections.

abstract = {In exploratory data analysis, the choice of tools depends on the data to be analyzed and the analysis tasks, i.e. the questions to be answered. The same applies to design of new analysis tools. In this paper, we consider a particular type of data: data that describe transient events having spatial and temporal references, such as earthquakes, traffic incidents, or observations of rare plants or animals. We focus on the task of detecting spatio-temporal patterns in event occurrences. We demonstrate the insufficiency of the existing techniques and approaches to event exploration and substantiate the need in a new exploratory tool. The technique of space-time cube, which has been earlier proposed for the visualization of movement in geographical space, possesses the required properties. However, it must be implemented so as to allow particular interactive manipulations: changing the viewing perspective, temporal focusing, and dynamic linking with a map display through simultaneous highlighting of corresponding symbols. We describe our implementation of the space-time cube technique and demonstrate by an example how it can be used for detecting spatio-temporal clusters of events.},
