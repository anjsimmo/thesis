% Revised intro
This thesis opened with a practical motivation, namely to use \gls{spatio-temporal} analysis techniques to deliver elite sport coaches new insights into their team's performance. However, not all information is necessarily insightful to coaches. As such, this background chapter begins by examining team sport from a coaching perspective, and showing where sport analysis---and by extension, automated sport analysis---fits within this larger context. The results of spatio-temporal sport analysis, regardless of how deep or sophisticated, are only insightful if they can provide the coach and other sport practitioners with meaningful information relevant to their objectives.

Following the high level coaching perspective, the background narrows to examine the specific sport of Australian Rules Football as played at the elite level in the Australian Football League (AFL). AFL is the main application throughout the rest of this thesis. However, the methods are, in principle, transferable to other team invasion sports.

Finally, the chapter conducts a review of the technological and analytical developments that have led to the rise of spatio-temporal data in Australian Rules Football.
