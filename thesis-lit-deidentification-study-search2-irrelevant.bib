Preseason workload volume and high-risk periods for noncontact injury across multiple Australian Football League seasons. J Strength Cond Res 31(7): 1821-1829, 2017-The purpose of this study was to assess the association between preseason workloads and noncontact injury risk in Australian football players. Individual player injury data were recorded over 4 full seasons (2012-15) from one professional club. Noncontact injury incidence (per 1,000 "on legs" field training and game hours) was compared across the preseason, precompetition, and in-season phases to determine relative noncontact injury risk. Preseason workloads (global positioning system-derived total distance run and sprint distance) and individual (fixed) injury risk factors (age, previous injury history) were incorporated into the analysis. A generalized estimating equation with a binary logistic function modeled potential risk factors with noncontact injury for selected periods across the annual cycle. Odds ratios were calculated to determine the relative injury risk. The (preseason) precompetition phase (19.1 injuries per 1,000 hours) and (in-season) rounds 12-17 (16.0 injuries per 1,000 hours) resulted in the highest injury incidence. Low cumulative total distances in late preseason ({\textless}108 km) and precompetition (76-88 km) periods were associated with significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater injury risk during the in-season phase. In conclusion, these results suggest players are at the greatest injury risk during the precompetition period, with low preseason cumulative workloads associated with increased in-season injury risk. Therefore, strength and conditioning staff should place particular emphasis on achieving at least moderate training loads during and leading into this phase, where competitive game play is first introduced. {\textcopyright} 2017 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

abstract = {Background Injuries to the hamstring are relatively common in professional cricketers (as they are in many team sports) and have increased in incidence in the “T20 era” (introduction of 20-over matches) of cricket since 2006. Methods This study analyzed incidence of hamstring injury in the various elite male match types over a 20-year period (1995–1996 to 2014–2015 seasons). Risk factors for hamstring strain were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis technique. Results There were 276 match time-loss hamstring injuries recorded over a 20-year period at the Australian state or national player level, of which 170 occurred in one of 40,145 player match sets. The overall rate of match onset rate was 22.5 hamstring injuries per 1000 team days. Fast bowling onset injuries were the highest subcategory at a rate of 10.9 injuries per 1000 team days, although batting onset injuries were particularly common in 50-over (one day) international matches. Significant risk factors in logistic regression analysis, in addition to hamstring injury history, were being a fast bowler relative risk (RR) 2.5 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.3–4.5) and playing a match in Australia RR 2.3 (95{\%}CI: 1.3–3.9). Conclusion Fast bowlers suffer more hamstring injuries than other playing roles in cricket, particularly in First Class (multi-day) cricket. Batsmen are more likely to get injured in 50-over (one day) cricket. Playing in Australia (compared to overseas venues) leads to increased risk of hamstring injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Examine the influence of rehabilitation training loads on return to play (RTP) time and subsequent injury in elite Australian footballers. 

DESIGN
Prospective cohort study. 

METHODS
Internal (sessional rating of perceived exertion: sRPE) and external (distance, sprint distance) workload and lower limb non-contact muscle injury data was collected from 58 players over 5 seasons. Rehabilitation periods were analysed for running workloads and time spent in 3 rehabilitation stages (1: off-legs training, 2: non-football running, 3: group football training) was calculated. Multi-level survival analyses with random effects accounting for player and season were performed. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for each variable were produced for RTP time and time to subsequent injury. 

RESULTS
Of 85 lower limb muscle injuries, 70 were rehabilitated to RTP, with 30 cases of subsequent injury recorded (recurrence rate=11.8{\%}, new site injury rate=31.4{\%}). Completion of high rehabilitation workloads delayed RTP (distance:{\textgreater}49775m [reference: 34613-49775m]: HR 0.12, 95{\%}CI 0.04-0.36, sRPE:{\textgreater}1266AU [reference: 852-1266AU]: HR 0.09, 95{\%}CI 0.03-0.32). Return to running within 4days increased subsequent injury risk (3–4days [reference: 5-6 days]: HR 25.88, 95{\%}CI 2.06-324.4). Attaining moderate-high sprint distance (427-710m) was protective against subsequent injury (154-426m: [reference: 427-710m]: HR 37.41, 95{\%}CI 2.70-518.64). 

CONCLUSION
Training load monitoring can inform player rehabilitation programs. Higher rehabilitation training loads delayed RTP; however, moderate-high sprint running loads can protect against subsequent injury. Shared-decision making regarding RTP should include accumulated training loads and consider the trade-off between expedited RTP and lower subsequent injury risk.},

abstract = {Objectives: Australian Football League (AFL) players have a high risk of injury. Anecdotally, this injury risk is greater in emerging players (i.e. those in their first year), compared with established players (with 3+ years of experience). This study aimed to conduct the first comparison of injury risk and playing experience in these two player groups across a large number of AFL clubs. Design: Prospective, cohort. Methods: Injuries, game participation and training participation were collected weekly by 8 AFL clubs for 61 emerging and 64 established players. Injury incidence rates (IIR) and Cox proportional hazard models for time to first injury, separately for games and training, were computed. Results: The game IIR was significantly higher for emerging than established players: 45.6 (95{\%} CI: 35.7, 57.6) versus 18.3 (95{\%} CI: 13.1, 24.9) per 1000 game-hours. Emerging players also had a higher training IIR than did the established players: 9.6 (95{\%} CI: 7.6, 11.9) versus 8.9 (95{\%} CI: 7.0, 11.1) per 1000 training-hours. Emerging players were significantly less likely to remain injury free in games than established players (HR = 3.46, 95{\%} CI: 1.27, 9.45). A similar outcome was seen in training sessions, although to a lesser degree (HR = 1.41, 95{\%} CI: 1.19, 1.69). Conclusions: Despite efforts to modify the playing/training program of emerging players, this group remain at greater risk of injury in games and training sessions, compared with established players. Continued efforts should be made toward understanding reasons for this increased risk to better prevent injury during the early years of a professional football career.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess the association between workload, subjective wellness, musculoskeletal screening measures and non-contact injury risk in elite Australian footballers. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Across 4 seasons in 70 players from one club, cumulative weekly workloads (acute; 1 week, chronic; 2-, 3-, 4-week) and acute:chronic workload ratio's (ACWR: 1-week load/average 4-weekly load) for session-Rating of Perceived Exertion (sRPE) and GPS-derived distance and sprint distance were calculated. Wellness, screening and non-contact injury data were also documented. Univariate and multivariate regression models determined injury incidence rate ratios (IRR) while accounting for interaction/moderating effects. Receiver operating characteristics determined model predictive accuracy (area under curve: AUC). Results Very low cumulative chronic (2-, 3-, 4- week) workloads were associated with the greatest injury risk (univariate IRR = 1.71–2.16, 95{\%} CI = 1.10–4.52) in the subsequent week. In multivariate analysis, the interaction between a low chronic load and a very high distance (adj-IRR = 2.60, 95{\%} CI = 1.07–6.34) or low sRPE ACWR (adj-IRR = 2.52, 95{\%} CI = 1.01–6.29) was associated with increased injury risk. Subjectively reporting “yes” (vs. “no”) for old lower limb pain and heavy non-football activity in the previous 7 days (multivariate adj-IRR = 2.01–2.25, 95{\%} CI = 1.02–4.95) and playing experience ({\textgreater}9 years) (multivariate adj-IRR = 2.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.03–4.06) was also associated with increased injury risk, but screening data were not. Predictive capacity of multivariate models was significantly better than univariate (AUCmultivariate= 0.70, 95{\%} CI 0.64–0.75; AUCunivariaterange = 0.51–0.60). Conclusions Chronic load is an important moderating factor in the workload–injury relationship. Low chronic loads coupled with low or very high ACWR are associated with increased injury risk.},

abstract = {AIMS (1) To investigate whether a daily acute:chronic workload ratio informs injury risk in Australian football players; (2) to identify which combination of workload variable, acute and chronic time window best explains injury likelihood. METHODS Workload and injury data were collected from 53 athletes over 2 seasons in a professional Australian football club. Acute:chronic workload ratios were calculated daily for each athlete, and modelled against non-contact injury likelihood using a quadratic relationship. 6 workload variables, 8 acute time windows (2-9 days) and 7 chronic time windows (14-35 days) were considered (336 combinations). Each parameter combination was compared for injury likelihood fit (using R(2)). RESULTS The ratio of moderate speed running workload (18-24 km/h) in the previous 3 days (acute time window) compared with the previous 21 days (chronic time window) best explained the injury likelihood in matches (R(2)=0.79) and in the immediate 2 or 5 days following matches (R(2)=0.76-0.82). The 3:21 acute:chronic workload ratio discriminated between high-risk and low-risk athletes (relative risk=1.98-2.43). Using the previous 6 days to calculate the acute workload time window yielded similar results. The choice of acute time window significantly influenced model performance and appeared to reflect the competition and training schedule. CONCLUSIONS Daily workload ratios can inform injury risk in Australian football. Clinicians and conditioning coaches should consider the sport-specific schedule of competition and training when choosing acute and chronic time windows. For Australian football, the ratio of moderate speed running in a 3-day or 6-day acute time window and a 21-day chronic time window best explained injury risk.},

abstract = {Objectives To examine different timeframes for calculating acute to chronic workload ratio (ACWR) and whether this variable is associated with intrinsic injury risk in elite Australian football players. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Internal (session rating of perceived exertion: sRPE) and external (GPS distance and sprint distance) workload and injury data were collected from 70 players from one AFL club over 4 seasons. Various acute (1–2 weeks) and chronic (3–8 weeks) timeframes were used to calculate ACWRs: these and chronic load categories were then analysed to determine the injury risk in the subsequent month. Poisson regression with robust errors within a generalised estimating equation were utilised to determine incidence rate ratios (IRR). Results Altering acute and/or chronic timeframes did not improve the ability to detect high injury risk conditions above the commonly used 1:4 week ACWR. Twenty-seven ACWR/chronic load combinations were found to be “high risk conditions” (IRR {\textgreater} 1, p {\textless} 0.05) for injury within 7 days. Most (93{\%}) of these conditions occurred when chronic load was low or very low and ACWR was either low ({\textless}0.6) or high ({\textgreater}1.5). Once a high injury risk condition was entered, the elevated risk persisted for up to 28 days. Conclusions Injury risk was greatest when chronic load was low and ACWR was either low or high. This heightened risk remained for up to 4 weeks. There was no improvement in the ability to identify high injury risk situations by altering acute or chronic time periods from 1:4 weeks.},
