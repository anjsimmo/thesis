abstract = {Humans have analyzed negative scenarios ever since they first sat around Ice Age campfires debating the dangers of catching a woolly rhinoceros: "What if it turns and charges us before it falls into the pit?" A more recent scenario is "What if the hackers launch a denial-of-service attack?" Modern systems engineers can employ a misuse case, the negative form of a use case, to document and analyze such scenarios. A misuse case is simply a use case from the point of view of an actor hostile to the system under design. Misuse cases have many possible applications and interact with use cases in interesting and helpful ways. The paper discusses the elicitation of safety requirements from failure cases and considers the interplay of design, functional, and nonfunctional requirements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene appears to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy and an increased incidence and rate of progression of renal disease. The high incidence of renal disease and end-stage renal failure in the Australian Aboriginal population has prompted investigation of ACE genotypes in these people. METHODS: ACE genotypes were determined in four groups: (i) normal Australian Caucasian blood donors (n = 100), (ii) Caucasian renal transplant recipients (n = 173), (iii) normal Australian Aboriginals from a single tribe (n = 184), and (iv) Australian Aboriginals included in the renal-transplant programme (n = 94). FINDINGS: The D allele frequency in the normal Australian Caucasian (54.5{\%}) and renal transplant groups (57.2{\%}) was similar. However, the D allele frequency in the normal Australian Aboriginal (3{\%}) and Aboriginal renal patient group (14.4{\%}) was significantly lower than both Caucasian groups. INTERPRETATION: The D allele of the ACE gene has little or no influence on the renal disease of Australian Aboriginals.},

abstract = {We present a new class of statistical de- anonymization attacks against high-dimensional micro-data, such as individual preferences, recommen- dations, transaction records and so on. Our techniques are robust to perturbation in the data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversary's background knowledge. We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the world's largest online movie rental service. We demonstrate that an adversary who knows only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily identify this sub- scriber's record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the source of background knowl- edge, we successfully identified the Netflix records of known users, uncovering their apparent political pref- erences and other potentially sensitive information. 1},

abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. In a recent study we partly reverse-engineered the algorithm. This paper presents the results of our second study. While the previous study provided a broad overview, the current study focused on analyzing the correlation of an article's citation count and its ranking in Google Scholar. For this study, citation counts and rankings of 1,364,757 articles were analyzed. Some results of our first study were confirmed: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that are cited less often. Therefore, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for searching standard literature than for gems or articles by authors advancing a view different from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. In some cases no correlation existed; in others bizarre patterns were recognizable, suggesting that citation counts sometimes have no impact at all on articles' rankings. 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews provide clinical practice recommendations that are based on evaluation of primary evidence. When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.
